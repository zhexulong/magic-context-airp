# release-dashboard.sh — Tag and push a new dashboard release
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/release-dashboard.sh 0.2.2                           # release dashboard-v0.2.2
#   ./scripts/release-dashboard.sh 0.2.2 --dry                     # preview without committing/pushing
#   ./scripts/release-dashboard.sh 0.2.2 --notes-file NOTES.md     # release with notes non-interactively
#
# What it does:
#   1. Validates the version is semver
#   2. Checks for clean working tree
#   3. Bumps version in tauri.conf.json
#   4. Runs Rust check (cargo check)
#   5. Commits the version bump
#   6. Creates a git tag (dashboard-v0.2.2)
#   7. Pushes commit + tag to origin
#   8. Waits for CI to build all platforms and finish the workflow
#   9. Reads release notes from /dev/tty or --notes-file
#  10. Publishes the draft release

# had three sequential 60-min poll loops (draft-exists → asset-count → workflow-
# conclusion) and only detected a failed leg in the LAST one — so a leg that
# died 23s in still cost ~10min of waiting behind the slow legs before the script
# noticed. Instead: poll the run's conclusion directly and ABORT THE INSTANT it
# concludes failure, regardless of how many legs are still nominally "running"
# (a concluded run means GitHub already stopped scheduling). One loop, one
# concern: did the run succeed?
