/**
 * Harness-agnostic transcript interface.
 *
 * Magic Context's transform pipeline operates on messages in a specific
 * shape: ordered messages with role-tagged parts (text, tool, reasoning,
 * tool_result, image), where tagging, sentinel stripping, and queued-drop
 * application MUTATE part content in-place. OpenCode's plugin transform
 * receives a `{ info, parts: unknown[] }[]` array and the AI SDK reads
 * those mutations directly. Pi's `pi.on("context", ...)` event delivers a
 * `AgentMessage[]` and accepts a fully-replaced array as the result.
 *
 * Rather than building a bidirectional `MessageLike[] ↔ AgentMessage[]`
 * adapter (Oracle's rejected Q1 alternative — too much round-trip
 * complexity, double-conversion bugs), this module defines a small
 * adapter contract that:
 *
 *   1. Exposes ordered messages with a *uniform* part-level mutation
 *      surface, regardless of underlying shape.
 *   2. Is owned by the harness — OpenCode's adapter mutates `parts[]`
 *      directly (zero copies), Pi's adapter rebuilds an `AgentMessage[]`
 *      from the mutated transcript only at commit time.
 *   3. Lets the shared transform code (tagging, stripping, drops)
 *      operate on `TranscriptPart` interface instances without caring
 *      whether they're wrapping `Part` from `@opencode-ai/sdk` or
 *      `TextContent | ToolCall | ThinkingContent` from `@earendil-works/pi-ai`.
 *
 * What this interface deliberately does NOT do:
 *
 * - **No data round-trip.** The transcript is a *view* over harness data;
 *   it doesn't define a third canonical message shape. There's no JSON
 *   serialization, no normalization to a common DTO. Round-trip-free
 *   adapters are 10x simpler and faster.
 *
 * - **No mutation semantics divergence.** Both adapters expose the same
 *   in-place mutation API (`setText`, `setOutput`, `replaceWithSentinel`).
 *   Whether mutation flushes to the source array immediately (OpenCode)
 *   or accumulates until `commit()` (Pi) is the adapter's concern.
 *
 * - **No session-storage abstraction.** Compartment storage, ordinals,
 *   raw-history reads — those live in feature modules, not here. The
 *   transcript only models the *current turn's* live message buffer.
 *
 * Step 4b.1 ships ONLY the interface and OpenCode adapter migration.
 * Pi adapter implementation lands in 4b.2 alongside the Pi context-event
 * wire-up, since the two are co-designed (the Pi adapter has to satisfy
 * the same operations the tagging code calls). 4b.3 wires the Pi
 * compartment trigger and historian invocation. 4b.4 nudges + auto-search.
