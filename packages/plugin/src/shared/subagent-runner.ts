/**
 * Cross-harness subagent runner abstraction.
 *
 * Magic Context spawns historian and Dreamer subagents
 * each as a child "session" with its own model/prompt/tools. OpenCode and Pi
 * have very different APIs for this:
 *
 *   - OpenCode: `client.session.create({parentID}) → client.session.prompt() →
 *     client.session.messages() → client.session.delete()`. The plugin runs
 *     in-process with the OpenCode server and uses its SDK client directly.
 *
 *   - Pi: no in-process child-session API. Instead `pi --print --mode=json`
 *     spawns a non-interactive subprocess that emits structured JSON events
 *     and exits when the agent loop finishes. Sessions are JSONL files on
 *     disk, optionally addressed via `--session <path>`.
 *
 * The runner interface below normalizes both into the same shape so the
 * actual subagent business logic (historian XML parsing and Dreamer task loops)
 * can stay harness-agnostic. Each harness ships its
 * own runner implementation; agents take a `SubagentRunner` as a dep instead
 * of reaching for `client.session.*` directly.
 *
 * Step 5a (this commit) defines the contract and ships `PiSubagentRunner`.
 * Step 5b will refactor the OpenCode-side spawn paths in
 * `compartment-runner-historian.ts` and `dreamer/runner.ts` onto an
 * `OpenCodeSubagentRunner` so both harnesses
 * share the agent business logic instead of duplicating it. Until 5b lands,
 * OpenCode keeps its existing direct `client.session.*` calls untouched —
 * the runner contract is purely additive on the OpenCode side.

/**
 * Configuration for one subagent invocation.
 *
 * Mirrors the union of OpenCode's `session.create` + `session.prompt` body
 * fields and Pi's `--print` CLI flags, picking the shared subset that all
 * the historian and Dreamer subagents actually use today.
 *
 * Fields:
 * - `agent`: harness-specific agent name. OpenCode looks this up in its
 *   agent registry (`HISTORIAN_AGENT`, `DREAMER_AGENT`).
 *   Pi has no concept of "agent name" beyond config, so this is ignored
 *   on the Pi side and used only by `OpenCodeSubagentRunner`.
 * - `systemPrompt`: full system prompt for this child run. Replaces (not
 *   appends to) any harness-default system prompt.
 * - `userMessage`: the single user-turn prompt. Subagent runs are always
 *   one-shot — no multi-turn conversation in the child.
 * - `model`: provider/model identifier in the canonical "provider/model"
 *   shape (e.g. "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-7"). Each runner is responsible
 *   for translating to its harness's native model selection.
 * - `fallbackModels`: ordered list of models to try if `model` fails. Both
 *   harnesses retry on transient model failures.
 * - `timeoutMs`: hard cap on the child run. The runner aborts the child on
 *   exceeding this and returns `{ ok: false, reason: "timeout" }`.
 * - `cwd`: working directory for the child. OpenCode uses this for
 *   `query.directory`; Pi uses it as the spawn cwd so that `--cwd`-aware
 *   tools see the right project root.
 * - `signal`: optional AbortSignal so callers can cancel an in-flight run
 *   (used by dreamer's lease-renewal-aborts-on-loss path).

 *     - `"invalid_prompt"`: a known zero-tool child was given no system prompt
 *     - `"timeout"`: hit `timeoutMs` before the child finished
 *     - `"abort"`: caller's `signal` was triggered
 *     - `"model_failed"`: every configured model + fallback returned an error
 *     - `"truncated"`: child stopped because model output hit length limits
 *     - `"spawn_failed"`: subprocess couldn't start (Pi only — binary missing,
 *       permission denied, etc.)
 *     - `"non_zero_exit"`: child exited unsuccessfully before a final answer

 *     - `"parse_failed"`: child emitted output we couldn't parse (Pi only —
 *       JSON malformed or unexpected event ordering)
 * - `error`: human-readable detail; safe to log, may include stack info.
 * - `durationMs`: wall-clock time from runner-call to runner-return.
 * - `meta`: optional harness-specific debug payload. Currently unused; left
 *   here so the OpenCode runner can surface the child session ID for log
 *   correlation when Step 5b lands.
