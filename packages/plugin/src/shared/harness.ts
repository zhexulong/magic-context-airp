 * (`~/.local/share/cortexkit/magic-context/`) so OpenCode, Pi, and OMP can share
 * project memories, embedding cache, dreamer runs, and other project-scoped
 * state. Session-scoped tables carry a `harness` column populated from this
 * module so we can disambiguate which harness wrote each session row,
 * filter by harness in the dashboard, and (eventually) migrate sessions
 * between harnesses.
 *
 * Each plugin entry point sets this once at boot, before any DB write
 * happens:
 * - OpenCode plugin: relies on the default ("opencode") — no setHarness call
 *   needed
 * - OpenCode 2 plugin: calls `setHarness("opencode2")` before opening the database
 * - Pi-compatible plugin: resolves the host and calls `setHarness("pi" | "omp")` before opening the database
 *
 * NEVER read this from configuration or session state — it is a
 * boot-time constant per plugin instance. Cross-harness leakage is a
 * correctness bug, not a feature.
