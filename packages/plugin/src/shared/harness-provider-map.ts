/**
 * Provider-id translation between the canonical (OpenCode) form stored in the
 * shared magic-context config and Pi's harness-native provider ids.
 *
 * Provider IDs are a harness boundary, not a database identity. Shared config
 * always stores the canonical OpenCode form. Each non-OpenCode harness owns an
 * explicit pair of edge transforms:
 *
 *   canonical (OpenCode)   Pi / OMP selector
 *   --------------------   -----------------
 *   openai/<model>         openai-codex/<model>
 *   google/<model>         google-antigravity/<model>
 *   anthropic/<model>      anthropic/<model> (same; every other provider too)
 *
 * Pi and OMP currently expose the same two subscription-provider aliases, but
 * their exported functions remain distinct deliberately. A future OMP catalog
 * rename must not silently change plain-Pi behavior (or vice versa).
 *
 * The OpenCode Zen gateway is the one place the two harnesses diverge: OpenCode
 * and plain Pi both name it `opencode`, while OMP exposes the same gateway as
 * `opencode-zen`. Only the OMP map carries that pair; plain Pi keeps `opencode`
 * as an identity. `opencode-go` is a distinct gateway (the "go" variant at
 * opencode.ai/zen/go) and stays unmapped on both harnesses.
 *
 * The mapping is intentionally not a one-to-one provider identity. Both
 * harnesses also expose plain `openai` and `google` providers for direct API
 * keys, while the canonical prefix does not record whether a subscription or
 * API-key backend should win. The runtime starts with the preferred
 * subscription form and subagent-runner may retry once with the untranslated
 * canonical form when that form reports missing credentials.
 *
 * Only the provider prefix before the first slash is translated. Model IDs,
 * including nested IDs containing more slashes, are preserved byte-for-byte.
 * Scoped or otherwise unknown provider prefixes are identities.
 *
 * OpenCode needs no translation because canonical is its native form.
