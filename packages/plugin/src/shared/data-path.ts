 *
 * Why a per-harness subtree of `os.tmpdir()`:
 *   1. OpenCode Desktop runs as an Electron app with a permission sandbox.
 *      Writing to arbitrary tmp paths can trigger user-visible permission
 *      prompts; the `${tmpdir}/opencode/` subtree is allow-listed by
 *      OpenCode, so anything we put under it never asks for permission.
 *   2. Splitting harnesses keeps their logs and historian dump directories
 *      cleanly separated. `doctor --issue` for each harness reports diagnostics
 *      from the matching subtree, so issue reports do not include another
 *      harness's log noise.
 *   3. Pi has no permission sandbox, so the path choice is purely
 *      cosmetic for Pi — it just keeps the layout symmetric.
 *
 * Pass an explicit `harness` only when the caller already knows the
 * harness without relying on the global `setHarness()` state (e.g. the
 * CLI's doctor commands, which target a specific harness regardless of
 * which plugin is loaded). Production runtime callers should omit it so
 * the helper picks up the boot-time harness automatically.

 * Resolve the shared magic-context storage directory.

 * plugin (OpenCode or Pi). This enables:
 *   - Shared project memories across harnesses
 *   - Shared embedding cache
 *   - Shared Dreamer runs (one per project per machine)
 *   - Future cross-harness session migration
 *
 * Resolution precedence: test isolation, MAGIC_CONTEXT_STORAGE_DIR, XDG data
 * home, then the platform default. The explicit override is a complete storage
 * directory and must be absolute so every process on a host selects one store.
 *
 * TEST-ISOLATION GUARD. `openDatabase()` has been guarded in
 * `resolveDatabasePath()` since the 2026-06-01 (v26) and 2026-06-19 (v41)
 * incidents, in which unisolated tests migrated the user's REAL shared DB.
 * Every OTHER caller bypassed that guard — notably the CLI doctors, which
 * build `join(getMagicContextStorageDir(), "context.db")` themselves and run
 * `PRAGMA integrity_check` against it. A test that deletes XDG_DATA_HOME to
 * exercise path fallbacks cannot restore isolation by setting
 * `process.env.HOME`: bun caches `os.homedir()` at startup, so `getDataDir()`
 * still resolves to the real home. MAGIC_CONTEXT_TEST_DATA_DIR — set by
 * `packages/plugin/test-preload.ts`, and restored by any test that touches it
 * — is honored here, so the preload's "cannot be defeated" guarantee holds for
 * every caller, not just `openDatabase()`. It is never set in production.
 *
 * CWD-INDEPENDENT BACKSTOP. The preload only runs when `bun test`'s CWD has a
 * bunfig wiring `[test] preload`. A run from a dir WITHOUT that wiring (a
 * package missing its bunfig, or a brand-new one) executes every *.test.ts with
 * NO preload, and this resolver would hand back the REAL shared path — which is
 * how the live DB reached v41. Bun sets NODE_ENV=test for EVERY `bun test`
 * regardless of CWD, and production never sets it, so that window redirects to
 * a memoized throwaway dir instead. It lives here rather than in
 * `resolveDatabasePath()` so direct callers (the CLI doctors' own
 * `PRAGMA integrity_check`, announcements, the models.dev cache) are covered
 * too — they never go through the DB resolver.
 *
 * In production, MAGIC_CONTEXT_STORAGE_DIR takes precedence over XDG_DATA_HOME.
 * Test isolation remains authoritative so an ambient override cannot redirect
 * a test into a user's real shared database.
