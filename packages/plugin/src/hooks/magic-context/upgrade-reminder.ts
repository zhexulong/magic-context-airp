/**
 * E5 — Session upgrade reminder (v2).
 *
 * When a session still holds pre-v2 (legacy) compartments, those render in a
 * degraded title-only/P4 form until the user runs `/ctx-session-upgrade`. This
 * surfaces a bounded, model-invisible reminder pointing at the command.
 *
 * Cache-safety (locked design): the reminder is delivered as an IGNORED message
 * (user-visible, never sent to the model), NOT appended to a user message — so it
 * has zero effect on the cacheable prompt prefix. No anchor/replay machinery needed.
 *
 * Push reminders are bounded per session. A durable timestamp enforces a 24-hour
 * cooldown, and a durable count caps deliveries at three. Pull surfaces such as
 * `/ctx-status` continue to show upgrade-needed compartments after the cap.
 *
 * The in-process set still prevents duplicate delivery before durable metadata is
 * read back.
