/**
 * Agent-initiated (ctx_reduce) and emergency drops of a tool call within the
 * newest N tool calls keep a structural skeleton when the call's input is
 * small: the tool_use/tool_result pair survives with its REAL arguments and
 * the canonical `[dropped §N§]` placeholder as its output (`skeleton_real`).
 * A large input is removed outright, like a drop outside the window.
 *
 * WHY a skeleton: when every recent tool call vanishes from the wire, models
 * (especially smaller ones) lose the anchors showing what they actually did
 * and start writing fake tool calls as plain text. Keeping skeletons in the
 * recent band prevents that. Older drops still remove the full structure.
 *
 * WHY real arguments: every synthetic value previously put in the argument
 * position (5-character clamps, then a `{"dropped": "[dropped §N§]"}` marker)
 * was copied by models into new calls, which then ran with garbage arguments
 * or looped on the dropped-input guard's refusal. A dropped call's arguments
 * are therefore either the real ones or absent. The size rule lives in
 * tool-input-size.ts.
 *
 * CACHE SAFETY: the mode is decided once, at drop time (always a
 * cache-busting pass), persisted in `tags.drop_mode`, and replayed
 * byte-identically by `applyFlushedStatuses` on every later pass. A skeleton
 * is NEVER demoted to a full drop afterwards — that second mutation would be
 * a mid-prefix rewrite on some later pass (the volatile-boundary bust class).
 * Emergency drops use the same newest-window skeleton rule as agent drops;
 * heuristic dedup stays full-drop because dedup keeps the newest duplicate's
 * full content as the nearby anchor.
