/**
 * `canConsumeDeferredOnThisPass` is the mid-turn-aware gate that decides whether
 * a deferred publication signal (deferred history refresh / materialization) may
 * be consumed on THIS transform pass. It takes the MID-TURN-ADJUSTED scheduler
 * decision, so a deferred publish that lands mid-turn (decision downgraded to
 * "defer") is NOT consumed until the next non-mid-turn execute/force pass. Pi
 * now mirrors this exact logic (it previously read the raw deferred-set
 * membership, draining mid-turn where OpenCode stayed deferred).
