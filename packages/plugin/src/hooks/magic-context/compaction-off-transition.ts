/**
 * Compaction-off mode transitions (issue #266, slice S3).
 *
 * The mode is boot-resolved and process-stable, so a transition is only ever
 * observed on a session's first transform pass after a restart that changed
 * the resolved value. Each session reconciles its durable per-session mode
 * record (`session_meta.compaction_mode_record`: NULL = no record, settled
 * "on"/"off", or durable pending-delivery/cleanup variants) against the
 * resolved mode:
 *
 *   - NULL resolves to "on" (every pre-feature session ran with compaction
 *     enabled), so `no record + configured-off` IS the off-transition — the
 *     upgrade path that guarantees marker cleanup reaches legacy sessions.
 *   - `no record + on` → write "on", no transition work.
 *   - `no record | on  → off` → exactly ONE off-transition per session:
 *       delete MC-owned compaction-marker lineages (canonical + supported
 *       legacy), clear the marker bookkeeping that references those rows,
 *       clear the emergency-recovery latch, clear any persisted Channel-2
 *       pending/claimed intent, clear pre-existing pending_ops, invalidate
 *       the cached m[0]/m[1] baseline (so the off-mode render never replays
 *       an on-mode `<session-history>`), then write "off".
 *   - `off → on` → exactly ONE on-transition: invalidate the cached
 *       m[0]/m[1] baseline (so the dormant compartments' session-history
 *       re-renders before raw-tail trimming resumes), write the historian
 *       catch-up signal (compartmentInProgress, conditioned on the historian
 *       being runnable) and offer the `/ctx-wrapup` suggestion out of band.
 *
 * Crash safety: every cleanup operation is idempotent. A transition that
 * emits a notice stages a durable `*_notice_pending` record before returning
 * to the caller for delivery; a restart therefore retries that notice rather
 * than inferring it from already-cleared state. Duplicate delivery after a
 * crash remains the accepted at-least-once cost.
 *
 * Notices are delivered OUT OF BAND by the caller (the boot-warning /
 * command-output surface) — never into the message array, never through the
 * nudge machinery. A transition pass's message-array output is
 * indistinguishable from a steady-state pass of the resolved mode.
