/**
 * Fork-orphan compaction-marker hygiene (#263).
 *
 * OpenCode's `/fork` copies the parent session's message rows into the fork —
 * including the parent's magic-context compaction-marker rows — but does NOT
 * inherit magic-context's durable state (PARITY.md gap #25: OpenCode re-mints
 * message ids on fork, so entry-id-keyed migration is unsafe). The fork then
 * injects its own fresh marker at its own (much older) historian boundary, and
 * `filterCompacted` — which walks newest→oldest and stops at the FIRST marker
 * it sees (opencode message-v2.ts `filterCompacted`) — honours the NEWER
 * orphan instead of ours. The visible window is cut at the orphan, our boundary
 * message falls below the cut, and inject-compartments degrades with no
 * recovery path while context usage climbs.
 *
 * A marker row in opencode.db for this session that the durable state does not
 * recognize as its own current marker is a fork-orphan. This pass scans for
 * them and removes the ones that actively outrank ours:
 *
 *   - not owned: `part.id != persisted.compactionPartId`
 *   - magic-context-shaped: carries one of OUR summary messages
 *     (providerID="magic-context") — OpenCode-native /compact markers carry the
 *     real provider id and are never touched
 *   - newer than ours: its boundary message sorts AFTER ours in canonical
 *     order, which is exactly the case where `filterCompacted` stops at the
 *     orphan first. Older foreign markers are harmless (ours already wins) and
 *     are left alone to keep the repair minimally invasive.
 *
 * Removal is idempotent (plain DELETEs) so concurrent processes racing on the
 * same orphan converge on the same end state; the only guarded invariant is
 * never deleting our own marker, re-checked against freshly-read persisted
 * state below.
 *
 * Cost gate: callers invoke this only when degraded mode fires (never on every
 * pass), so steady state pays nothing. Any failure is swallowed and reported
 * via the result so the next degraded pass retries.

 *   state. Those can't be surfaced from here (we don't track them), but the
 *   natural-healing path already handles them: the next historian publication
 *   moves the boundary forward and the new injection replaces the orphans by
 *   moving filterCompacted past them.
 *
 * This function only diagnoses missing rows. A discovered database path does
 * not prove which store the server writes, and startup has no cache-busting
 * permission. Retain state and surviving rows; the deferred publication drain
 * performs replacement on a priced pass instead.
