export const CTX_EXPAND_DESCRIPTION = `Recover the original conversation behind your compacted history.

Earlier turns are summarized in <session-history> under \`## start-end · date · title\` headings; each heading stands for the raw messages in that ordinal range. When the summary isn't enough — exact wording, a value, an error message, the reasoning behind a decision — expand the range: ctx_expand(start=120, end=245). Also works around a ctx_search message hit: start=N-10, end=N+5. Ranges after the last compartment are your live tail — already visible, not expandable.

Returns the raw transcript as [N] U:/A: lines, capped at ~15K tokens; an oversized range returns the head and says where to continue.

Finer recovery:
- verbose=true lists each message separately with its ordinal and a per-part preview (tool calls with output sizes) so you can pick one.
- message=N returns that one message in full — every text part and every tool call's complete input and output — from stored history. This is the way back to a tool output you released with ctx_reduce; if the message was deleted from history it says so.`;
