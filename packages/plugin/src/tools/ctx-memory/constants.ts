Your active memories are already in <project-memory> as \`#id: fact\` lines. Write one when you learn something that must not have to be found again — a project rule, an architectural fact, a hard-won constraint, a config value, a naming convention — and especially when it cost you turns to find. One standalone fact per memory, phrased to make sense on its own. A pending intention with its evidence ("do X later, here is what we know") is ctx_note, not memory.

Actions:
- write: new memory (content + category).
- update: rewrite one memory whose fact changed (ids: [one], content; category optional to recategorize).
- archive: retire wrong or obsolete memories (ids: [one or more], optional reason).
- merge: collapse duplicates into one (ids: [two or more], content).
- get: fetch by id (ids: 1–20), readable in every status.
