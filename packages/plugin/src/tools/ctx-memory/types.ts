// Actions a PRIMARY (non-dreamer) agent may run. Primary agents see active
// memories — with their ids — in the injected <project-memory> block, so they
// can target a specific memory to archive/update/merge in-session without
// waiting for the dreamer. `archive` is the single soft-remove action (sets
// status='archived'); the former `delete` action was an exact alias of it and
// was removed. `list` (bulk enumeration) stays dreamer-only. `get` is the
// id-shaped read that the user-facing <project-memory> ids imply but no
// dreamer-only-free action covered — the agent is given a memory id
// (dashboard, guidance, this very block) and there is no other way to look
// it up. Memory verification (file mapping) and classification
// (importance/scope/shareable) are no longer tool actions — the verify and
// classify dreamer tasks apply them host-side from a manifest, so the agent
// never calls a tool for them.
