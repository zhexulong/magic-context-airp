 * memory entries authored through the dashboard (user-typed rows), which were
 * designed but never implemented. It must NEVER be written by the agent
 * (historian/dreamer/tool) write paths — origin provenance matters to the
 * agent, historian dedup, and dreamer curation, so agent-originated memories
 * must never carry `"user"`. `insertMemory` enforces this at the write
 * boundary.
 *
 * Note: "was this addition user-ignited" is a SEPARATE future concern from
 * `sourceType`. A prompt-driven agent write made at the user's request is
 * still `sourceType: "agent"` (or `"tool"`); user-ignition would be carried
 * by a distinct field if it is ever needed.
