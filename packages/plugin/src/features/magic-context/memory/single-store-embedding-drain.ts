/**
 * Embed the memories another writer put into `memories` without an embedding.
 *
 * Vectors are computed here in the host, by a provider, with a hash-guarded save — they
 * are not maintained by a database trigger the way the full-text index is. So a memory
 * row written by the Rust module arrives unembedded and nothing would ever ask for one:
 * the paths that normally trigger embedding all run on the host's own write.
 *
 * The module therefore records a per-project high-water mark on `memories.id` as it
 * writes, and this drain is what reads it. A mark rather than a per-row column is the
 * point: it leaves the `memories` table byte-identical between the two writers, so a row
 * cannot be told apart by who wrote it.
 *
 * Everything here is a no-op on a project the module has not written: the watermark table
 * is empty, so there is nothing to drain.
