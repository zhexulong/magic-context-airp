/**
 * Memory migration (v2 / E3.2): re-evaluate a project's existing memories into
 * the 5-category v2 world taxonomy via a one-shot historian-model prompt.
 *
 * Why this exists: pre-v2 memories use the 9-category taxonomy (ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS,
 * USER_DIRECTIVES, WORKFLOW_RULES, KNOWN_ISSUES, ENVIRONMENT, USER_PREFERENCES, …)
 * collected under LOOSER definitions. v2's 5 categories (PROJECT_RULES, ARCHITECTURE,
 * CONSTRAINTS, CONFIG_VALUES, NAMING) have STRICTER definitions, so this is a quality
 * re-evaluation (drop stale / demote-to-narrative / merge), not a relabel. USER_* traits
 * leave project memory entirely (they belong in the global user-profile store).
 *
 * Runtime shape (locked):
 *  - Runs on-demand inside `/ctx-session-upgrade`, ONCE per project (idempotent guard).
 *  - Uses the HISTORIAN model/plumbing (not dreamer) so it works even when dreamer is
 *    disabled — the historian model is guaranteed present whenever an upgrade is relevant.
 *  - Project-scoped: operates on the project's memory pool, shared across sessions.
 *
 * This module owns the PURE pieces (prompt builder, parser, apply, guard). The LLM
 * call + child-session orchestration lives in the caller (command-handler), mirroring
 * how the dreamer/historian invoke `promptSyncWithModelSuggestionRetry`.
