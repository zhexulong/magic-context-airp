/**
 * Conditional `opencode`/`opencode2` harness relabel driven by host-store evidence
 * (migration v87).
 *
 * Background. Migration v85 rewrote EVERY `opencode2` row to `opencode` on the
 * premise that no released Magic Context had ever run on a real OpenCode 2 host,
 * so every such row had to be the OpenCode 1.x mislabel (ungated `setup()` locked
 * the harness to "opencode2" on a 1.18.x seat). That premise held for most
 * installs and was wrong for early adopters: a store written by a genuine
 * OpenCode 2 host had its rows relabelled, the 2 host kept writing `opencode2`,
 * and every tag and session row it had already written became invisible to it
 * (issue #475: 2,788 tags and 32 session_meta rows).
 *
 * What this does instead. The label is decided PER SESSION from the OpenCode
 * store itself — the same store the runtime reads — and only when that store
 * answers. The rule is "whoever wrote the session most recently owns the label":
 *
 *   newest 2.x activity  > newest 1.x activity → `opencode2`
 *   newest 1.x activity  > newest 2.x activity → `opencode`
 *   equal, or the session is in neither generation's tables → leave unchanged
 *
 * 2.x activity is read from `session_message`/`session_v2` and counted only when
 * `session_v2` exists: a 1.18.x store ships an (empty) `session_message` table
 * too, so `session_v2` is the table that proves a 2.x host has touched the store
 * (PR #477). 1.x activity is read from `message.time_updated` and, for sessions
 * with no messages, the `session.time_updated` row the host maintains.
 *
 * The equal case is not a theoretical tie. When an OpenCode 2 host migrates a
 * 1.18.x store it copies each `session` row into `session_v2` with
 * `time_created`/`time_updated` PRESERVED and moves no messages (observed with
 * the real 1.18.30 and 2.0.5 binaries; pinned in
 * `__fixtures__/opencode-store-shapes.json`). A migrated-but-never-used session
 * therefore reports the same timestamp on both sides, which is exactly "no
 * evidence of who wrote last" — so the stored label stands. Once either host
 * writes again, its side becomes strictly newer and wins, which is what makes a
 * downgraded store (2.x migrated, then 1.x used again) resolve to `opencode`.
 *
 * When the store cannot be resolved or read, NOTHING is relabelled: the affected
 * session ids are recorded in `schema_migrations_meta` so `magic-context doctor`
 * can report the unresolved repair, and the situation is logged once.

 *
 * `tags` is deliberately absent: its UNIQUE key is (session_id, tag_number) and

 * tag rows for one message are left alone on purpose — the tagger binds a
