/**
 * Permission rulesets for Magic Context's hidden subagents.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Hidden agents (`historian`, `historian-editor`, `dreamer`) are
 * registered with `mode: "primary"` and `hidden: true`: primary mode keeps
 * them out of OpenCode's general Task candidate list, while hidden keeps them
 * out of the UI picker. Those flags do NOT restrict which tools the spawned
 * session can call. By default a registered agent
 * inherits the FULL primary-agent tool surface: `task`, `bash`, `edit`,
 * `webfetch`, `websearch`, `read`, `grep`, `glob`, every MCP tool, etc.
 *
 * That default is wrong for our agents:
 *   - Historian should be a pure XML-emitting summarizer. It must not
 *     dispatch `task(subagent_type=explore)` to fan out, edit files,
 *     run bash, or fetch the web — its job is to read offloaded state
 *     files and emit `<compartment>` blocks.
 *   - The `task` permission only gets auto-denied when an agent is
 *     INVOKED via the parent's `task()` tool (see OpenCode's
 *     `deriveSubagentSessionPermission`). Our hidden agents are spawned
 *     directly via `client.session.prompt(...)` from the plugin
 *     runtime, so that auto-deny never fires — they get the same
 *     `task` permission as a primary `build` agent.
 *
 * # Design
 *
 * Each hidden agent's `permission` field starts with `{ "*": "deny" }`
 * and adds explicit `allow` entries for ONLY the tool ids it needs.
 * OpenCode's `Permission.fromConfig` converts this flat map into a
 * `Rule[]` ruleset where later entries override earlier ones, so the
 * named allows always win against the wildcard deny.
 *
 * This is the same pattern OpenCode's own `explore` subagent uses
 * (see `packages/opencode/src/agent/agent.ts:179-201`).
 *
 * User-supplied agent overrides (`pluginConfig.historian.permission`,
 * etc.) still merge on top via OpenCode's `Permission.merge`, so
 * advanced users can extend the allow-list without us blocking them.
 *
 * # What each agent needs
 *
 *   - **historian / historian-editor / compressor**: `read` plus the
 *     read-only AFT navigation/search tools `aft_outline`, `aft_zoom`,
 *     and `aft_search`. The runner offloads large existing-state XML to
 *     a temp file under `<project>/.opencode/magic-context/historian/`
 *     and the prompt instructs the model to read that file. AFT
 *     navigation is allowed so historian can find or verify a symbol or
 *     file structure when writing accurate compartment summaries.
 *
 *   - **dreamer**: `read`, `grep`, `glob`, `bash`, `write`, `edit`, the
 *     read-only AFT navigation/search tools `aft_outline`, `aft_zoom`,
 *     `aft_search`, plus the Magic Context MCP tools `ctx_memory`,
 *     `ctx_search`, `ctx_note`.
 *     Dreamer task prompts in
 *     `features/magic-context/dreamer/task-prompts.ts` explicitly tell
 *     the model to grep schema files for defaults, read source to
 *     confirm claims, run `git log` / `gh` / `curl` for verify and
 *     smart-note evaluation, and use glob/find for directory
 *     inventory. Live DB shows >100 bash invocations across all
 *     dreamer task variants. `task` / `edit` / `write` / `webfetch` /
 *     `websearch` remain denied — dreamer must not spawn subagents
 *     or commit changes.
