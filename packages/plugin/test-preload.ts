// Test-isolation guard — runs ONCE before any test file is imported (wired via
// bunfig.toml `[test] preload`). It forces XDG data and config homes to one
// throwaway temp tree for the whole test process.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: `openDatabase()` with no explicit path resolves the shared
// cortexkit DB through `getDataDir()` = `XDG_DATA_HOME ?? ~/.local/share`. Any
// test that calls bare `openDatabase()` without setting XDG_DATA_HOME therefore
// opens the user's REAL production database
// (~/.local/share/cortexkit/magic-context/context.db). That is harmless only
// while the DB's schema version already equals LATEST_SUPPORTED_VERSION — the
// moment LATEST advances, that test runs the new migration on the user's LIVE
// DB. 2026-06-01 incident: a long-dormant unisolated test migrated the
// production DB to v26 the instant LATEST hit 26, tripping the schema fence and
// fail-closing every running v25 binary. Separately, #388 found that a
// fixture-scoped test could resolve the user's real embedding endpoint and
// model through the user config tier.
//
// Redirecting both homes here makes it STRUCTURALLY impossible for any test —
// current or future, isolated or not — to read production storage or user-tier
// config. Tests that set their own XDG_DATA_HOME or XDG_CONFIG_HOME still work
// because they override the preload root per test.
