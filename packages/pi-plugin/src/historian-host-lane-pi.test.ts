/**
 * Where a Pi session stands when the shared config puts the historian in the
 * host lane.
 *
 * The host lane is a Rust-transform arrangement: the module queues a run and a
 * host process claims it. Pi has no Rust transform mode, no module client and no
 * claim-lane caller, so nothing in a Pi session can queue a run — which means the
 * failure this pins against is not "Pi claims badly" but "a run is queued with
 * nobody to answer it". These tests state what a Pi session actually does with
 * `historian.runner: "host"`, so a later change that makes Pi queue without
 * giving it a claimant cannot land quietly.
