/**
 * Regression coverage for the "context kept climbing after historian
 * ran" bug.
 *
 * Symptom: user reported usage at 64% climbing to 69%+ even after a
 * successful historian run published new compartments. Drops the
 * historian queued sat in `pending_ops` and never materialized until
 * usage crossed the 85% force-materialization threshold.
 *
 * Root cause: Pi historian + compressor publications were signaled too
 * eagerly or incompletely. They must now use the deferred refresh /
 * materialization signals so defer passes remain cache-stable, then the
 * next execute/materialization pass drains both together.
 *
 * OpenCode parity reference: `transform.ts:502-505` signals BOTH sets
 * inside `onInjectionCacheCleared` (the equivalent callback). Comment
 * explicitly enumerates why both are needed.
 *
 * Source-inspection tests (rather than runtime mocks) because the bug
 * is structural — what goes inside the `onPublished` callback — and
 * the contract is short and stable enough to pin via grep.
