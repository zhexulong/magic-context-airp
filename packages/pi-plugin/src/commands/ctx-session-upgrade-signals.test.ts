/**
 * Contract coverage for `/ctx-session-upgrade`'s detached, background-safe
 * execution.
 *
 * The upgrade (multi-pass recomp + memory migration) runs DETACHED via
 * spawnPiRecompRun so the single-process Pi REPL stays responsive — parity with
 * OpenCode's `void runManagedUpgrade`. A previous build awaited the recomp
 * inline in the command handler, which froze ALL input (prompts and even
 * /ctx-status) for the whole upgrade (dogfood 2026-06-01: a 1105-message
 * upgrade locked the REPL across several ~4-min historian passes).
 *
 * Because it runs in the background, the post-publish signals MUST be the
 * DEFERRED variants (staged for the next cache-busting pass at a turn boundary),
 * and the native compaction marker MUST be staged (not applied eagerly, which
 * mutates getBranch immediately and could land during a cache-stable pass).
