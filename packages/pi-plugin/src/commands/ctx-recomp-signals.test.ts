/**
 * Regression coverage for the `/ctx-recomp` post-completion signal contract.
 *
 * Pi `/ctx-recomp` runs DETACHED (background) so the single-process REPL stays
 * responsive — parity with OpenCode's `void runManagedRecomp`. Because it runs
 * in the background (not inside the user's turn), the post-publish signals MUST
 * be the DEFERRED variants (`signalPiDeferredHistoryRefresh` /
 * `signalPiDeferredMaterialization`), exactly like the background historian's
 * `onPublished`. The eager variants would force a materialization on whatever
 * cache-stable transform pass happens to be running, causing an avoidable bust.
 * The deferred signals stage the work so the next cache-busting pass at a turn
 * boundary drains it.
 *
 * These signals fire only when the recomp actually published, and they live
 * inside the detached `work()` body (which spawnPiRecompRun owns the try/catch
 * for), not on a failure path.
