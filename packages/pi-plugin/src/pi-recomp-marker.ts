 * and the JSONL branch actually trims.
 *
 * Shared by `/ctx-recomp` AND `/ctx-session-upgrade`. The upgrade path is a full
 * recomp that rebuilds every compartment; without this call it republished
 * compartments but never moved the native marker, so the entire pre-upgrade
 * branch stayed visible and grew unbounded until a later incremental historian
 * pass happened to advance it. (The m[0]/m[1] materialization signals the
 * upgrade already fires drive the synthetic `<session-history>` render — NOT the
 * native marker that trims `getBranch()`; those are separate mechanisms.)
 *
 * No-ops safely when the Pi session manager exposes neither appendCompaction nor
 * getBranch, when there is no compartment yet, or when no real replay-safe
 * entry exists at or after the boundary (so we never stage an unmatchable
 * synthetic marker).

/**
 * Stage the Pi compaction marker WITHOUT applying it, then signal a deferred
 * history refresh so the next cache-busting transform pass drains and applies it
 * via the pipeline's deferred-marker path.
 *
 * Used by detached recomp and upgrade runs: applying the marker eagerly
 * (`appendCompaction`) mutates `getBranch()` immediately and could alter a
 * cache-stable pass. Staging + deferred drain mirrors the background historian's
 * `onPublished` signals so the marker rides the next genuine bust. No-ops safely
 * when the boundary has no
 * replay-safe entry at or after it (same guards as the eager path).
