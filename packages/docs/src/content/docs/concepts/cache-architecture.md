description: How Magic Context's message layout preserves prompt cache stability and batches the rewrites that do incur cache cost.
---

This page is for the curious and the cost-conscious. It explains why Magic Context's internal message layout looks the way it does, which bytes remain frozen between folds, and why the folds that rewrite them are batched.

## The problem

LLM providers cache the prefix of your prompt. If the first 100,000 tokens of your prompt are byte-identical to the last request, the provider reuses the cached computation and charges you less (Anthropic, for example, bills cached tokens at 10% of the normal rate).

The catch: if you change even one byte early in the prompt, everything after it re-bills at full price. A system that mutates the conversation history on every turn — dropping tool outputs, re-compressing summaries, injecting new memories — would invalidate the cache constantly and cost more than no context management at all.

## The solution: stable baseline + volatile delta

Magic Context renders the compacted history into **two synthetic message slots** instead of one. Internally these are called **m[0]** and **m[1]**:

**m[0] — the cumulative baseline.** This holds project docs, the baseline user profile, and the decay-rendered compartment history as of the last materialization. It is treated like a frozen prefix: it does **not** change on routine turns, so its prompt-cache bytes persist across requests.

**m[1] — the volatile delta.** This holds everything added since the last m[0] materialization: new user-profile additions, new memories (surfaced via a **watermark** — memories with IDs above the last materialized max), and the newest compartments rendered at full fidelity. When there's nothing new, m[1] renders a minimal placeholder.

The system prompt, m[0], and m[1] form a prefix that stays byte-identical across most turns. Only the conversation tail (the raw messages after the last compartment boundary) changes on every request. The component that assigns `§N§` tags to messages (internally called the **tagger**) runs on every pass but its output is replayed byte-identically, so it doesn't bust the cache either.

## The bust taxonomy

Not all cache invalidations are equal. Magic Context classifies them into three tiers:

**SOFT+ (no bust).** A defer pass with nothing new. Both m[0] and m[1] replay byte-identical. The entire `system + m[0] + m[1]` prefix stays cached. Only the conversation tail moves as `ctx_reduce` drops or age-based cleanup land.

**SOFT (m[1] bust).** An execute or cache-busting pass. m[1] re-renders with new compartments, memories, or user-profile additions. m[0] stays byte-identical. The `system + m[0]` prefix stays cached; the bust happens at m[1].

**HARD (m[0] bust).** A materialization event. m[0] re-materializes, folding m[1] into the new decayed baseline and resetting m[1] to the placeholder. Everything rebuilds — but this only fires when the provider cache was already dead (model change, idle timeout, system prompt change) or when m[0] content genuinely changed (memory edits from the dashboard, structural compartment operations).

## What triggers a HARD bust

m[0] re-materializes only for events where the cache was already invalidated or the baseline content genuinely changed:

- **Provider-side eviction:** model or provider change, system prompt hash change, idle timeout past the TTL.
- **Content change:** first render, project memory epoch change (dashboard edits), pending structural mutations (compartment delete/merge/recomp), project docs hash change.

Deliberately **not** triggers: new compartments (those ride the m[1] delta), new memories from in-session writes (those surface via the watermark in m[1]), and new user-profile additions (additive, also in m[1]). Triggering on any of these would bust m[0] on routine background work and defeat the design.

## The decay and fold cycle

The [historian](/concepts/historian/) publishes new compartments continuously. They render in m[1] at full fidelity (P1). On a HARD bust, m[1] folds into m[0] — and during that fold, the decay renderer re-tiers all compartments based on their current age, importance, and budget pressure. Older compartments demote to lower tiers; very old ones archive entirely.

Between HARD busts, the decay tiers are frozen. A SOFT pass never re-tiers — that would change m[0] bytes. This means the rendered history is stable until the next natural materialization.

A **pressure backstop** forces a fold when m[1] grows too large relative to m[0] — gated by the size ratio, an absolute token cap (around 20% of the history budget), or a large memory-mutation count. This prevents marathon sessions from accumulating an oversized delta.

## Memory mutations route through m[1]

When the agent writes a memory via `ctx_memory`, it does **not** trigger an m[0] rebuild. Additive writes surface in m[1] via the watermark. Non-additive mutations (update, delete, archive) record a mutation log entry that renders as a `<memory-updates>` delta in m[1]. Both reconcile into m[0] on the next natural HARD bust.

Only **dashboard** memory edits and `/ctx-session-upgrade` migrations bump the project memory epoch, forcing an immediate m[0] re-materialize. These are external editors that can't otherwise signal a running session.

## Price folds, not every turn

A fold is a prompt-cache rewrite. Providers may price cache writes and uncached input above cache reads, so frequent small folds can repeatedly bill overlapping prefix bytes. Magic Context batches due history, memory, and reduction work into fewer rebuilds; every ordinary turn between them replays the stable prefix byte for byte.

`cache_ttl` is Magic Context's assumption about how long the provider retains that prefix. Its default is `5m`, and it can vary by model. When the assumed TTL has expired during idle time, Magic Context can rebuild on the next turn because it treats the old provider cache as gone. This setting does not change the provider's actual cache policy. See the [generated configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#context-management).

## Honest framing

Occasional full re-materializations are by design. They happen when:

- The model or provider changes (the cache was dead anyway).
- The session has been idle past the TTL (the cache expired).
- You edit memories through the dashboard (an external change the session needs to pick up).
- The m[1] delta grows too large (the pressure backstop fires).

In a steady-state working session, m[0] stays stable for hours or days. The prompt cache survives the whole session, and you pay cached-token rates for the large prefix.

## How it connects

The cache architecture is the foundation that makes [the session lifecycle](/concepts/overview/) affordable. The [historian](/concepts/historian/) publishes compartments that ride the m[1] delta. [Memory](/concepts/memory/) writes surface through m[1] watermarks. [Context reduction](/concepts/context-reduction/) drops land on the conversation tail without touching m[0] or m[1]. And the [session mode](/concepts/session-modes/) determines which features participate in the cache-stable layout.
