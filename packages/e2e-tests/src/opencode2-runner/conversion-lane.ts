/**
 * Boot the real OpenCode 1.18.x host and the real OpenCode 2.0.5 host, in turn,
 * on ONE throwaway data root, with the Magic Context plugin loaded on both.
 *
 * This is the only place in the suite where both host generations write the same
 * OpenCode store. The 2.x host converts the 1.x `message`/`part` tables into its
 * own `session_message` projection on first open, which renumbers the message
 * list Magic Context saved its coordinates against. Reproducing that needs a
 * store a real 1.x host wrote, a real 2.x host to convert it, and a real 1.x host
 * to open it again on the way back.
 *
 * Isolation is the whole safety story here, because the 1.x binary this uses is
 * whatever `opencode` the operator has on PATH — the same binary their own
 * sessions run under. What makes that safe is the ROOT, not the binary: every
 * private directory, the OpenCode database filename and the Magic Context
 * storage directory are redirected into a throwaway tree under the temp
 * directory, the child environment is an allowlist rather than an inherited one,
 * and the child's open file descriptors are sampled and checked against the
 * operator's live store before and after the run.
