/**
 * What a fold buys a Rust-mode session on OpenCode 2, measured on the real host.
 *
 * Two facts meet here. The host decides to compact from the usage reported for
 * the request Magic Context actually served, so a fold that shrinks the served
 * array is what takes the host back below its own trigger. And this host's
 * `compaction` hook must be ANSWERED: leaving `result` unset is not a polite
 * decline, it makes the host summarize with its own model and, when that answer
 * is not in the template it requires, record `compaction.failed` and end the
 * turn. So the checkpoint the host stores has to be Magic Context's own
 * baseline, on every request, or the session either stalls or starts carrying a
 * summary of history the module never served.
 *
 * The mock therefore reports usage proportional to the bytes it received, the
 * way a provider does. A fixed usage number would keep the host above its
 * trigger for ever and make the cadence below unmeasurable.
 *
 * Its own file on purpose: each scenario boots a hermetic daemon, a module and a
 * GA host, and two such stacks in one Bun process do not both come up. The rust
 * lane already runs one file per fresh process for the same reason.
