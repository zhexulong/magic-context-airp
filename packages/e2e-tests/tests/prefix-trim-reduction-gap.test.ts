/**
 * The "boundary sorts before the first live message" prefix-trim log on a real
 * OpenCode 1 host.
 *
 * Shape reproduced from production: the latest compartment ends on an
 * assistant step B in the middle of a turn, and the assistant steps after B
 * carry nothing but tool calls that were fully dropped earlier. OpenCode loads
 * all of them (its window starts at the compaction marker, before B). On the
 * first pass after a restart, compartment injection cuts the window through B,
 * then drop replay empties the tool-only steps after B and removes them, so the
 * first message left is the first step that still has content. The prefix trim
 * then finds B absent. It used to log "boundary B sorts before the first live
 * message F ... whole window kept", which read as if OpenCode's window started
 * after B and the steps between were lost. They were served to Magic Context
 * and removed on purpose, and the line now says they were cut or removed this
 * pass.
 *
 * The test builds that state directly: one turn with a small tool step (B), a
 * large tool step (the gap) and a text step (F); a compartment ending at B; the
 * gap step's tool tag recorded as fully dropped; the cached m[0] cleared so the
 * next pass materializes a baseline at B; then a restart. It asserts that the
 * gap step is in OpenCode's store and absent from the provider request, and
 * that the log line says the rows between were cut or removed this pass.
