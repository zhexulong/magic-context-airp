/**
 * Historian publishes a compartment end-to-end.
 *
 * This test drives:
 *   - 11 user turns, each with meaningful text
 *   - Turn 11 carries 90K tokens to cross the 40% execute threshold AND
 *     make the tail eligible (>=12 messages)
 *   - Mock historian returns a VALID response matching the chunk
 *
 * Assertions:
 *   - At least one historian request was issued
 *   - The compartments table has a row after historian finishes
 *   - session_meta.compartment_in_progress is cleared
 *
 * This verifies the full write path: event-handler trigger → transform starts
 * historian → historian runs → response is validated → compartment is
 * persisted → in-progress flag is cleared.
