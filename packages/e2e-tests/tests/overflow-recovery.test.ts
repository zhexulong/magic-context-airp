/**
 * Context-overflow recovery (issue #32 regression test).
 *
 * Scenario: a model with a MISDETECTED context limit — the plugin (and
 * everything downstream) believes the model has a 128K window, but the real
 * provider limit is 120K. This is the exact trap from issue #32 where
 * `lemonade/GLM-4.7-Flash-GGUF` (a local GGUF model) is not in models.dev,
 * so `resolveContextLimit()` falls back to the 128K default while the real
 * runtime limit is smaller.
 *
 * ## What this verifies (end-to-end)
 *
 * 1. **Detection** — When the provider returns an overflow error, the plugin
 *    parses it against the shared overflow pattern set and records:
 *       - `session_meta.needs_emergency_recovery = 1`
 *       - `session_meta.detected_context_limit = <real limit parsed from error>`
 *
 * 2. **Pressure correction** — The very next transform pass resolves context
 *    limit from `session_meta.detected_context_limit` (the persisted real
 *    limit) instead of the models.dev / default fallback, so pressure math
 *    finally reflects reality.
 *
 * 3. **Recovery** — The emergency recovery flag forces the percentage to 95%
 *    even if the model's self-reported usage still looks low, which fires
 *    the existing 95% emergency path (abort + historian + aggressive drops).
 *    NOTE: recovery runs on a transform pass AFTER detection. On opencode
 *    <=1.15 an overflow triggered in-turn compaction (a second pass same
 *    turn), so recovery completed same-turn. On opencode >=1.16 (commit
 *    7e09660c3, "respect disabled auto compaction on overflow") a session
 *    with `compaction.auto:false` — the Magic Context default — errors the
 *    turn and goes idle with NO in-turn second pass, so recovery fires on
 *    the user's NEXT prompt. The plugin is correct in both cases; this test
 *    drives a follow-up turn and asserts on persisted state so it is
 *    version-agnostic.
 *
 * 4. **Completion** — When historian successfully publishes a compartment,
 *    the recovery flag is cleared so future turns aren't stuck at 95%.
 *    `detected_context_limit` remains — it's the authoritative real limit
 *    and remains valuable for future pressure math.
 *
 * ## Why this is an e2e test, not a unit test
 *
 * Unit tests already cover the pattern matcher, storage helpers, and the
 * `resolveContextLimit` session-override path individually. What this test
 * verifies is the integration: that the `session.error` event from OpenCode
 * actually reaches our handler, the persisted state is actually read by the
 * next transform, and the historian actually clears the flag.
