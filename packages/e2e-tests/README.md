# @cortexkit/opencode-magic-context-e2e

End-to-end test harness for the Magic Context plugins (OpenCode and Pi). Spawns
a real `opencode serve` subprocess (or a Pi child process) pointed at a local
mock provider and drives sessions through the appropriate harness.

> Note: the package name retains its original `-e2e` suffix from when this only
> covered OpenCode; Pi e2e coverage was added alongside under `tests/pi-*.test.ts`.

## Running

```bash
# From repo root
bun run test:e2e

# Or directly in this package
cd packages/e2e-tests && bun test
```

## Paired TS/Rust provider-wire replay

The replay driver sends the same sanitized multi-turn fixture through two fresh
sessions in one isolated stack: first with the TypeScript transform, then with the
Rust transform. It captures the request surface seen by the provider after every
turn and compares logical value spaces rather than assuming byte identity.

Run from `packages/e2e-tests`:

```bash
# The fixture's first arm (Anthropic Messages)
bun run replay:transform-wire-parity

# A named provider arm
bun run replay:transform-wire-parity -- --provider-arm openai-responses

# A custom fixture; --provider-id only overrides the selected arm's registered id
bun run replay:transform-wire-parity -- --fixture ./fixtures/my-replay.json --provider-arm anthropic
```

The command prints sanitized JSON and exits nonzero when any value-space difference
is not covered by an exact adjudication. It needs the same Rust prerequisites as
`test:rust-e2e`. The CI-sized guards are `tests/paired-session-replay.test.ts`
(differ classification) and `tests/rust-paired-session-replay.test.ts` (real paired
stack).

### Fixture contract

`fixtures/parity-hunt-14-session-shape.json` is schema 2. Its top level contains
capture provenance plus `provider_arms`. Each arm declares a stable `id`, the
OpenCode `provider_id` / `model_id`, its AI SDK `provider_api`, its wire family,
and its own ordered passes. A pass contains a synthetic user byte length and one
response or a `sequence` of responses. Sequences let one user turn consume multiple
scripted provider responses when the scenario requires them. An arm may also declare
`setup` to create a real OpenCode tool arc before its measured passes. The Responses
arm uses the companion Anthropic mock for that setup, then replaces the synthetic
empty tool result with the expected non-Anthropic `[dropped]` sentinel in the isolated
session database. The measured requests still go through the selected Responses API;
setup exists only to reproduce the sanitized pre-pass session shape deterministically.

Anthropic responses use `blocks` with text/thinking byte lengths, dropped-marker
class, and signature length. OpenAI Responses responses use `items`: assistant
messages, reasoning items (summary and encrypted-content lengths), and function
calls with synthetic arguments. Fixtures must retain only structure, byte lengths,
and categorical markers from a capture; never copy captured prose, paths, session
ids, tool arguments, or signatures. Synthetic arguments may be added solely to
drive deterministic harness behavior.

The differ currently reports these axes for every pass:

- empty string/array content shapes;
- isolated or embedded `[dropped]` placeholders;
- signed/unsigned reasoning item positions; and
- paired, missing, or orphaned tool calls/results.

Raw byte counts, first differing byte, and role/item structure are diagnostic. They
do not make a run fail by themselves because provider adapters can add harmless
metadata. A value-space mismatch increments `divergence_count`. An adjudication
removes it from `unadjudicated_divergence_count` only when the pass, axis, complete
`ts_only` set, and complete `rust_only` set match exactly. Use adjudications only
for reviewed provider-safety differences; never use one to bless an unexplained
shape or a changing subset. The CLI exit code is based on the unadjudicated count.

To add a provider arm:

1. make the local mock accept and emit that provider's real request/stream protocol;
2. add an arm with explicit `provider_api`, `wire_family`, and sanitized passes;
3. teach `paired-session-replay.ts` to materialize and classify the family if its
   request items differ from the existing Messages or Responses surfaces;
4. add a hermetic assertion that the intended sentinel, reasoning, and tool shapes
   are actually shared, not merely absent in both lanes; and
5. run the named arm once directly plus the focused differ and Rust replay tests.

## Architecture

- **`src/mock-provider/server.ts`** — local Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Responses
  mock HTTP server. Accepts POST `/messages` and `/responses`, supports SSE streaming
  (default for OpenCode) and single-shot JSON, lets tests script responses with
  precise control over token usage, and captures every request body for assertions.

- **`src/opencode-runner/spawn.ts`** — Subprocess runner that launches `opencode serve`
  with an isolated config/data/cache directory, a configurable local provider pointed
  at the mock, and the magic-context plugin loaded from local source via
  `file://` spec. No npm install required; the plugin is loaded directly from
  `packages/plugin/src/index.ts`.

- **`src/pi-runner/`** + **`src/pi-harness.ts`** — Pi-flavored counterpart to the
  OpenCode runner. Spawns a real Pi child process pointed at the same mock
  Anthropic server and loads the Pi plugin from local source.

### Pi RPC harness

Pi e2e tests run through `pi --mode rpc`, not `pi --print --mode json`. Each
`PiTestHarness` owns one persistent Pi subprocess for its lifetime and talks to
it over strict JSONL on stdio: commands are newline-delimited JSON objects on
stdin, while stdout interleaves `type: "response"` command replies with async
agent events such as `agent_start`, `message_end`, and `agent_end`.

`harness.sendPrompt()` sends a `prompt` RPC command, collects the event slice
from `agent_start` through `agent_end`, and returns the historical
`PiRunResult` shape. Because the Pi process remains alive after each turn,
`exitCode` and `signalCode` are `null` until `harness.dispose()` shuts the
worker down. Multi-turn tests do not need `--continue`; the existing
`continueSession` option is accepted as a compatibility no-op.

The harness also exposes thin RPC helpers for tests that need persistent-process
state directly: `getState()`, `getMessages()`, `getSessionStats()`,
`compactNow()`, and `newSession()`.

RPC mode is available in the installed Pi peer range. The current peer is
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@^0.71.0`; the lockfile resolves `0.71.1`, whose
packaged docs specify the JSONL RPC protocol, and the changelog shows the
current JSON protocol was introduced in `0.16.0`.

- **`tests/*.test.ts`** — Test suites. OpenCode-flavored suites use `harness.ts` /
  `opencode-runner`; Pi-flavored suites (`tests/pi-*.test.ts`) use `pi-harness.ts` /
  `pi-runner`. Each test creates a session, sends prompts, and asserts against
  SQLite state, log output, and captured mock requests.

- **`tests/rust-*.test.ts`** — Rust-mode (ck-mc over subc) lane. Drives the FULL
  production path opencode → plugin → subc daemon → ck-mc module through a
  hermetic stack (`src/rust-harness.ts` + `src/rust-runner/hermetic-subc.ts`),
  reusing the mock provider and session-driving machinery unchanged. Run it
  separately (it is NOT part of the default `test` run or the CI host suite):

  ```bash
  # From this package (or `bun run test:rust-e2e` from the repo root)
  bun run test:rust-e2e
  ```

   Runtime: ~1-2 minutes locally once the binaries are warm. Every invocation asks
   Cargo to build both release binaries so `ck-mc` and `ck-subc` reflect the same
   sibling source revision. The builds share the durable e2e-only cache at
   `packages/e2e-tests/.cache/rust-e2e-cargo-target`, rather than either source
   workspace's `target` directory; unchanged builds reuse Cargo's incremental
   artifacts without contending with a developer build in either workspace.
   Each scenario keeps its session small (tens of turns, tiny context limits) so
   the suite stays fast.

### Rust-mode lane: how it works

The lane spawns a real `ck-subc` daemon (from the sibling `subconscious`
workspace, the same binary `crates/mc-module/tests/real_daemon.rs` uses) and the
`ck-mc` module (this workspace) connected to it, then boots `opencode serve` in
Rust transform mode against them. The wiring uses no product change: the plugin's
Rust module client reads the default connection file at
`${XDG_DATA_HOME}/cortexkit/run/subc-connection.json`, and the harness points the
daemon's `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` there so its connection file lands exactly where the
plugin looks. The module opens its own store under the same data dir (the
production shared-cortexkit layout).

Environment honesty: `RustTestHarness.detectPrereqs()` preflights the stack
(cargo present, sibling `subconscious` workspace present, supported platform) and
the suite SKIPs with a printed reason when any is missing — never green-washing,
never hanging.

### Rust build-lock contention drill

To verify that a live sibling build cannot block the harness, start a deliberately
slow `cargo build --release -p subc-core --bins` in `../subconscious` in one
terminal, then run `bun run --cwd packages/e2e-tests test:rust-e2e` in another.
The e2e lane must build and run successfully while the sibling build is active:
its Cargo invocations use `packages/e2e-tests/.cache/rust-e2e-cargo-target`, not
`../subconscious/target`. Stop or wait for the background sibling build after the
drill; it is only a contention probe.

**Pressure technique (load-bearing apparatus rule):** scenarios reach high fill
by SHRINKING the context limit against REAL message bytes, never by inflating
reported usage. The two techniques are not interchangeable: inflated usage moves
only fill-keyed conditions (execute thresholds, force bands) while every
real-byte-keyed condition (reclaimable-tail pressure, tail-size trigger floors,
chunk substance) stays silently unreachable — a harness built that way passes
every fill-keyed test honestly while structurally unable to exercise the other
axis, with nothing announcing the gap. (Observed live 2026-08-14 in a peer
gateway's drive container: 44 passes, fill 80→86%, `eligible_chunk_tokens`
pinned at exactly 0.0 the whole time.) If a scenario needs a shortcut, shrink
the window; if you must inflate, document which asserted conditions become
unreachable.

Gated scenarios (skip with a printed reason until their dependency lands):

- **Fold-dependent** (`fold-under-pressure`, `ctx-reduce-roundtrip`) — the Rust
  module runs its own historian, which drives an LLM through a separate `broca`
  runner module the current hermetic stack does not spawn. Without it no
  compartment is published, so no fold (or drop-on-fold) can land. Set
  `MC_RUST_E2E_FOLD=1` once a hermetic broca runner is wired.
- **Removal reconcile** (`removal-self-heal`) — a mid-session `session.revert`
  still wedges the Rust ordinal resolver (a distinct gap from the merged
  tail-readopt / park-self-heal fix). Set `MC_RUST_E2E_REMOVAL=1` once the removal
  ordinal-reconcile self-heal lands.
- **Duplicate tool-use IDs** (`duplicate-tool-use-id`) — consuming a queued drop on
  a selection bust needs the hermetic `broca` runner. Set
  `MC_RUST_E2E_DUPLICATE_IDS=1` once that runner is provisioned; the test body
  always walks every served message array, even while gated.

### CI

The Rust-mode lane is intentionally NOT wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
Beyond the Rust toolchain (which GitHub-hosted runners can install), it needs the
sibling **`subconscious`** workspace checked out beside this repo to build the
`ck-subc` daemon — the CI checkout does not provision that separate repo, so the
lane cannot build there without extra wiring. When a runner (or a container image)
provisions the subconscious sibling, add a job that runs
`bun run --cwd packages/e2e-tests test:rust-e2e`. Until then the lane runs
locally / on a suitably provisioned host only, and the CI host suite explicitly
excludes `rust-*.test.ts`.

## Requirements

- `opencode` CLI available on PATH for OpenCode suites (`which opencode`).
- Pi CLI installed for Pi suites (see `packages/pi-plugin/README.md`).
- Bun.
- For the Rust-mode lane (`tests/rust-*.test.ts`): `cargo` on PATH and the sibling
  `subconscious` workspace checked out beside this repo (to build `ck-subc`). The
  lane skips with a printed reason when these are absent.
- No `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` required — the spawner explicitly strips it so the
  test server runs unsecured on a random localhost port.

## Writing a test

```ts
import { MockProvider } from "../src/mock-provider/server";
import { spawnOpencode } from "../src/opencode-runner/spawn";

const mock = new MockProvider();
const { baseURL } = await mock.start();
const opencode = await spawnOpencode({ mockProviderURL: baseURL });

// Script exactly what the main agent should return on each turn.
mock.script([
    { text: "response 1", usage: { input_tokens: 10_000, output_tokens: 50 } },
    { text: "response 2", usage: { input_tokens: 50_000, output_tokens: 50, cache_read_input_tokens: 10_000 } },
]);

// Drive the session via the SDK.
const { createOpencodeClient } = await import("@opencode-ai/sdk");
const client = createOpencodeClient({ baseUrl: opencode.url });
const { data: session } = await client.session.create({ query: { directory: opencode.env.workdir } });
await client.session.prompt({
    path: { id: session!.id },
    body: {
        model: { providerID: "mock-anthropic", modelID: "mock-sonnet" },
        parts: [{ type: "text", text: "turn 1" }],
    },
});

// Assert against captured requests and plugin state.
expect(mock.requests().length).toBe(1);

await opencode.kill();
await mock.stop();
```
