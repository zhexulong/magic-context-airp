/**
 * HarnessAdapter — abstracts what the unified Magic Context CLI needs to know
 * about a specific agent harness (OpenCode, Pi, or Oh My Pi).
 *
 * Each adapter covers:
 *   1. *Detection* — is the harness installed? is the plugin registered with it?
 *   2. *Configuration* — where do its config files live, how are they read/written?
 *   3. *Runtime state* — log file, storage dir, plugin cache dir
 *   4. *Setup* — how a user installs/registers our plugin with it
 *
 * Everything here is synchronous or returns synchronously-resolvable
 * structures; async work lives in the command layer.
