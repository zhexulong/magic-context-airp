/**
 * Shared model-selection UX for the setup wizard (both OpenCode and Pi).
 *
 * Replaces the old per-harness `buildModelSelection` recommendation trees, which
 * hardcoded a curated list of "recommended" model ids. That was wrong for two
 * reasons: it surfaced models the user often didn't have, and it buried the
 * user's actual models below a capped tail (issue #144). Instead we now show the
 * user's FULL real model list, sorted, in a scrollable type-ahead picker, with a
 * short explanation of what each background role does and the (important) note
 * that these roles do NOT need a frontier model.
