// Single source of truth for which magic-context config fields the dashboard
// ConfigEditor surfaces. Enforced by config-parity.test.ts against the
// generated assets/magic-context.schema.json: every schema leaf must be either
// RENDERED by the form or explicitly OMITTED_BY_DESIGN here. A newly-added
// schema field that is neither fails CI — which is the mechanism that stops the
// dashboard form from silently drifting out of sync with the plugin schema (the
// failure mode that left the `experimental.*` namespace rendering long after it
// was graduated).
//
// A schema leaf `L` is covered by an entry `P` when `L === P` or
// `L.startsWith(P + ".")`, so an object prefix (e.g. "embedding") covers all of
// its children when the form renders the whole subtree.

/**
 * Path prefixes the form actually renders. Keep in sync with the JSX below it
 * in this directory. Once the form becomes schema-driven this list can be
 * derived instead of hand-maintained.
