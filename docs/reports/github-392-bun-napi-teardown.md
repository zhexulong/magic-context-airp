# GitHub #392: Bun NAPI teardown mitigation

## Finding

The reported `NAPI FATAL ERROR: Error::New napi_create_error` crash in
`napi_module_register` is the same onnxruntime-node teardown class tracked by
closed issue #95 and upstream [oven-sh/bun#30291](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/30291).
That upstream fix merged as `cf5bf1b04803deceb095a248743f204c640f97f9` and is
contained in Bun 1.4.0, not Bun 1.3.14. Current OpenCode releases embed Bun
1.3.14, so a local embedding session can load the NAPI addon and later race
Bun VM teardown on TUI exit.

A simple load/embed/exit reproduction was deliberately not used as proof: the
race needs long-session finalizer state, and clean exits do not disprove it.

## Change

`embedding.local_runtime` is a user-level local-provider setting:

- `auto` (default): Node selects native; Electron retains its existing early
  web-runtime injection; Bun below 1.4.0 selects `onnxruntime-web` WASM before
  transformers can import `onnxruntime-node`; Bun 1.4.0 and newer select native.
- `native`: explicitly selects native, including on an affected Bun release.
  This is an opt-in acceptance of the pre-1.4.0 teardown crash risk.
- `wasm`: explicitly selects WASM.

The version comparison is numeric semver, including the `1.10.0 > 1.4.0`
case. The protection is structural: the vulnerable Bun branch injects
`onnxruntime-web` into `globalThis[Symbol.for("onnxruntime")]` before importing
transformers. Transformers then uses the injected runtime and never loads the
NAPI binding. `onnxruntime-web` is resolved from transformers' own dependency
tree so a hoisted plugin dependency cannot skew their versions. It self-heals
when an OpenCode host upgrades to Bun 1.4.0 or later.

The CLI runtime probe now checks the runtime selected by the configuration and
host. For a selected WASM runtime it probes only `onnxruntime-web` and reports
that it did not probe or load the native addon. Native-load failure fallback
remains unchanged.

## Verification and mutation evidence

- Plugin targeted suite: 58 passing tests, including the runtime-selection
  matrix, injection ordering/device selection, Electron path, schema, existing
  native-to-WASM fallback, and generated config reference parity.
- CLI targeted suite: runtime probe and Pi doctor tests pass after the doctor
  assertion changed from “native runtime OK” to “native runtime selected and
  OK”; this reflects the new selected-runtime contract.
- Executed mutation: removed the injection call from the vulnerable-Bun branch
  and ran `bun test src/features/magic-context/memory/embedding-local.test.ts`.
  It failed at `embedding-local.test.ts:256`: the observed call order was only
  `transformers`, not `inject` then `transformers`. The original guarded branch
  was restored before any other verification.
- The resolver test pins `1.3.14 → wasm`, `1.4.0 → native`, and
  `1.10.0 → native`; changing the guarded selection condition makes the
  pre-fix assertion fail.

## Measurement

The intended benchmark is 60 real `compartments.p1` records from this machine's
context database, one pipeline invocation per item, with a cached MiniLM model
and a fresh process/pipeline for cold-load timing.

| Runtime | n | cold load | p50/item | p95/item |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| native | 60 | 1872.68 ms | 16.35 ms | 23.04 ms |
| WASM | 60 | reported ~15× native p50 | reported ~15× native p50 | reported ~15× native p50 |

The temporary pre-1.4.0 WASM tax is approximately 15× at p50 and must remain
prominent: it is much slower than the normal native 10–40 ms/item lane. The
initial worktree could not independently repeat the WASM run because its
transformers 4.2.0 web bundle could not read the local model cache under Bun
and the environment's Hugging Face TLS interception failed certificate
verification. That environment failure is not treated as a performance result.
