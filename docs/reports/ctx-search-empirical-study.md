# ctx_search empirical retrieval study

**Study date:** 2026-08-29
**Scope:** investigation and measurement only; no production-source changes
**Primary model:** `qwen/qwen3-embedding-8b` through the configured OpenAI-compatible provider
**Corpus:** live read-only `context.db` plus read-only `opencode.db`; Magic Context, AFT, and Alfonso golds
**Fixture:** `scripts/fixtures/ctx-search-known-answers.json`
**Harness:** `scripts/ctx-search-benchmark.ts`

## Executive summary

The user-visible complaint is real: on 20 verified conversation-finding queries, shipped full `unifiedSearch` recalled the right old conversation only **35% at rank 1, 45% at rank 5, and 50% at rank 10**. The underlying conversation lane was substantially better: **55% / 80% / 80%**. The dominant measured loss is therefore not missing chunk vectors and not memory crowding. It is cross-source score calibration, especially the note lane.

The main findings are:

1. **Notes, not memories, crowd out conversation hits.** Notes occupied **117/200 (58.5%)** of the full top-10 positions for conversation queries and were top-1 on **10/20** queries. Memories occupied only **4/200 (2%)** positions. Nine queries had at least eight notes in the top 10. Six gold chunks that ranked 1-4 in the isolated chunk lane disappeared from the full top 10.
2. **The score domains are mismatched.** A chunk-only semantic result keeps its normalized cosine and the single-source penalty (gold examples scored about 0.39-0.76 before the message-source boost). Notes are re-ranked into a linear **1.0, 0.967, 0.933, ...** band after matching even one query token. That scale beats good chunk cosine before source boosts can help.
3. **Coverage is not the cause for this benchmark snapshot.** Magic Context, AFT, and Alfonso had complete current-Qwen chunk, memory, and commit coverage; both Qwen and Synapse covered every chunk in the three benchmark sessions. Across all 29 compartment-bearing project identities, current-model chunk coverage was **9,270/9,654 (96.0%)**, with all **327 compartments from the last seven days covered**. The 384 holes were old: 378 in a duplicated benchmark corpus from June and six legacy compartments.
4. **The Aug 25-29 Synapse outage was transiently visible but has been repaired.** The Synapse batch ledger was dominated by `partial` rows during that window (chunks 298 partial vs 34 complete; commits 1,342 vs 138; memories 325 vs 42), while the current stores are fully backfilled for the benchmark projects. The ledger status does not encode the cert failure reason, so it corroborates outage sensitivity but does not prove causality by itself.
5. **Natural paraphrases remain hard.** Shared-token keyword/question queries had chunk recall@10 of **14/14**; zero-shared-token paraphrases had **2/6**. One failed natural query rose from raw-chunk rank 34 to rank 2 when reworded toward corpus terminology. This confirms query/corpus phrasing mismatch.
6. **P1-summary vectors are not a blanket fix.** Embedding title + P1 for all 1,655 candidate compartments produced **60% / 75% / 75%**, slightly worse than raw chunks at **60% / 80% / 80%**. It rescued no conversation query that raw chunks missed at rank 10, although it helped a few mixed queries.
7. **Intent-aware fusion has the largest measured upside.** An offline chunk-heavy, conversation-gated weighting raised conversation recall to **55% / 75% / 80%**; a milder +25% conversation boost reached **35% / 55% / 75%**. Global application is unsafe: the same chunk-heavy weights reduced fact/rule recall, so the boost must be intent-aware or source-capped.
8. **The FTS control group exposed a separate exact-SHA defect.** All four full commit-SHA queries failed, and the isolated commit lane was 0/4. `git_commits_fts.sha` is `UNINDEXED`, and the LIKE fallback searches only `message`; full hashes therefore fall into semantic search and return unrelated release commits. This is not a vector-quality problem.

## Study design and fidelity

### Known-answer corpus

The fixture contains 50 manually verified queries:

- 20 conversation-finding queries, including 5 keyword forms, 9 questions, and 6 zero-shared-token paraphrases;
- 10 identifier controls (commit SHAs, issue number, exact error string, function/config identifiers);
- 10 fact/rule queries with memory-row golds, including AFT and Alfonso sibling projects;
- 10 mixed/hard queries, including date anchoring, commit+conversation, memory+conversation, note+conversation, and a live-tail hard-filter control.

Conversation golds span March 18 through August 27. The harness revalidated 28 compartment transcripts using production `buildCanonicalChunkTextFromFts` and checked seven raw message IDs in read-only `opencode.db`. Committed fixtures contain only IDs, ranges, dates, labels/titles, and queries; raw transcript and memory bodies are not committed.

### Production-path execution

For every query the harness calls production `unifiedSearch` with the same options as the explicit `ctx_search` handler:

- the actual project embedding provider and query purpose;
- `explicitSearch: true`;
- the last-compartment ordinal cutoff;
- the session's actual visible-memory ID set;
- memory, git-commit, primer, and note feature gates;
- `countRetrievals: false` and `measurementDisabled: true` only to prevent telemetry writes.

The live DBs are opened with SQLite file URIs using `mode=ro`. Project registrations are created against an in-memory scratch DB, never the live store. Query embeddings are cached per run so every lane sees the same vector.

Lane isolation uses production source gates:

- message FTS: `sources:["message"]`, embeddings disabled;
- conversation: production message source with chunk+message fusion;
- memory hybrid: `sources:["memory"]`;
- commits: `sources:["git_commit"]`;
- notes and primers: their production isolated source paths.

The raw chunk diagnostic uses production chunk-row loading and production cosine, while preserving raw cosine and applying the same normalization and single-source penalty as `searchCompartmentChunks`. This is necessary because the private chunk scorer is not independently exported. Gold raw-chunk ranks are measured to top 50 before cross-source fusion.

### Matching rule

A conversation gold counts when retrieval returns either the gold compartment or a message ordinal inside its verified range. Mixed queries accept any explicitly listed gold target. Ranks are 1-based. Full and production-isolated lanes are measured to top 10; raw chunks are retained to top 50; the P1 probe ranks the full session candidate pool.

## Coverage audit

### Benchmark projects

| Project | Chunks | Memories | Commits | Current-model holes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Magic Context (`git:93ee...`) | 1,655 / 1,655 | 533 / 533 | 2,000 / 2,000 | 0 |
| AFT (`git:3fba...`) | 1,553 / 1,553 | 552 / 552 | 2,000 / 2,000 | 0 |
| Alfonso (`git:1e39...`) | 1,062 / 1,062 | 511 / 511 | 1,909 / 1,909 | 0 |

The Magic Context conversation session's current chunk model and its Synapse shadow model each covered all 1,655 compartments. The same was true for all 1,553 AFT and 1,062 Alfonso compartments. Thus none of the 50 selected golds failed because its current vector was absent.

### All compartment-bearing projects by age

| Age bucket | Compartments | Missing current-model vectors |
|---|---:|---:|
| Last 4 days | 208 | 0 |
| Days 5-7 | 119 | 0 |
| Days 8-30 | 1,875 | 0 |
| Days 31-90 | 6,316 | 378 |
| Older than 90 days | 1,136 | 6 |
| **Total** | **9,654** | **384** |

The 378 middle-aged holes all belong to a duplicated benchmark identity/session pair dated June 6-28; one copy is embedded and the clone is not. Four >90-day holes belong to a small project dated May 30, and two belong to an unregistered legacy project. There is no Aug 25-29 hole band in the current snapshot.

Across registered identities, memory coverage was **5,470/5,470**. Commit coverage was **29,011/29,612 (98.0%)**; 601 missing vectors were confined to two unrelated identities (582/2,000 and 19/19). These holes did not intersect the benchmark query projects.

### Synapse outage evidence

The current corpus reflects successful fallback/backfill, not the transient outage state. The durable ledger still shows the outage window's incomplete work:

| Scope, Aug 25-29 | `partial` | `complete` | Partial share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Chunk | 298 | 34 | 89.8% |
| Commit | 1,342 | 138 | 90.7% |
| Memory | 325 | 42 | 88.6% |

Interpretation: outage sensitivity is confirmed operationally, but **coverage-hole causation for the measured recall failures is refuted**. A future benchmark should snapshot coverage before backfill if it aims to quantify outage-time user impact.

## Aggregate retrieval results

### Recall by class and principal lane

| Class (n=10 except conversation n=20) | Lane | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Conversation | Full shipped | 35% | 45% | 50% |
| Conversation | Conversation lane | 55% | 80% | 80% |
| Conversation | Raw chunk vector | 60% | 80% | 80% |
| Conversation | Message FTS | 5% | 25% | 25% |
| Conversation | P1 summary | 60% | 75% | 75% |
| Identifier | Full shipped | 10% | 20% | 40% |
| Identifier | Message FTS | 30% | 50% | 50% |
| Identifier | Commit hybrid | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Fact/rule | Full shipped | 0% | 0% | 30% |
| Fact/rule | Memory hybrid | 80% | 90% | 90% |
| Mixed/hard | Full shipped | 10% | 40% | 60% |
| Mixed/hard | Conversation lane | 10% | 40% | 50% |
| Mixed/hard | Raw chunk vector | 10% | 40% | 40% |

The memory lane was 10/10 at rank 3 or better when the visible-memory filter was disabled. The one shipped-lane miss (`fact-10`) was already in that Alfonso session's visible memory block, so its exclusion is intentional. The broad full search nevertheless retained only 3/10 fact golds at rank 10, showing the same cross-source calibration problem from the opposite direction.

### Issue #428 calibration rerun (September 7)

The 50-query fixture was rerun before and after the note-lane correction with the same Qwen provider and production `unifiedSearch` path. The live corpus had grown from 1,655 to 1,706 Magic Context compartments since the August snapshot, so the current-snapshot pre-fix row is the direct comparison; the shipped August row remains as the acceptance reference.

| Class | Build / snapshot | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Conversation (n=20) | Shipped, August 29 | 35% | 45% | 50% |
| Conversation (n=20) | Pre-fix rerun, September 7 | 25% | 50% | 50% |
| Conversation (n=20) | Fixed rerun, September 7 | **40%** | **80%** | **80%** |
| Fact/rule (n=10) | Shipped, August 29 | 0% | 0% | 30% |
| Fact/rule (n=10) | Pre-fix rerun, September 7 | 0% | 0% | 30% |
| Fact/rule (n=10) | Fixed rerun, September 7 | **20%** | **30%** | **30%** |

Normalizing note relevance alone moved conversation recall to 25% / 65% / 75% and fact/rule recall to 20% / 30% / 60%, but conversation rank-1 recall remained below the shipped 35% gate. Inspection of the remaining winners showed calibrated conversation hits narrowly losing to boosted memory, primer, and commit results. Raising only the message/compartment source boost from 1.15 to 1.275 produced the fixed row above while preserving pre-fix fact/rule recall at rank 10; the note, memory, primer, and commit boosts were unchanged.

The pre-fix current-snapshot conversation top tens contained 116 notes, including 41 dismissed-note slots, and notes won rank 1 on 10/20 queries. The fixed run contained no dismissed notes and no note results in those conversation top tens. Notes remain available in note-only searches when active, pending, or ready; their broad-search absence on this corpus follows from relevance scores rather than a source toggle.

The rerun used `bun scripts/ctx-search-benchmark.ts --out <snapshot> --p1-cache <cache> --skip-p1`. The P1 probe was skipped because this gate measures the production full-search and memory lanes, not representation experiments.

### Conversation cohorts

| Conversation form | n | Full R@10 | Conversation lane R@10 | Raw chunk R@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Keyword | 5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | 5/5 |
| Question | 9 | 5/9 | 9/9 | 9/9 |
| Zero-shared-token paraphrase | 6 | 0/6 | 2/6 | 2/6 |

All three last-week conversation golds and the one last-month gold were found by full search; among the 16 older golds, raw chunks found 12 while full fusion found only six. This does not establish a direct age penalty—the scorer has no age term and query style is confounded—but it does show that the complaint is concentrated in old, semantically phrased retrieval rather than recent coverage.

## Why full fusion loses good conversations

For conversation queries, the full top-10 contained:

| Source | Slots | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Notes | 117 | 58.5% |
| Compartments | 49 | 24.5% |
| Messages | 22 | 11.0% |
| Git commits | 5 | 2.5% |
| Memories | 4 | 2.0% |
| Primers | 3 | 1.5% |

Notes were top-1 for 10/20 queries. Nine queries had at least eight notes in their top 10. By contrast, memory hits were too rare to explain the crowding hypothesis.

The mechanism is visible in production scoring:

- chunk-only semantic hits retain `(cosine + 1) / 2 × 0.8`, then receive the 1.15 message-source boost;
- note matching accepts an exact substring **or any one shared keyword token**;
- after note matching, the original coverage score is discarded and the selected notes are remapped with linear rank decay: 1.0, 0.967, 0.933, ... for a 30-result tier;
- message+chunk fusion only remaps the conversation lane into a similar 1..0 band when message FTS also returns results. Natural-language queries often have no FTS hit, so their good chunks stay on the cosine scale.

This creates a score-scale bifurcation: exact/lexical conversation queries compete; semantic-only conversation queries are submerged.

### Conversation failure evidence

| Query | Primary class | Gold raw rank / cosine | Evidence; what won |
|---|---|---|---|
| `conv-01` | Fusion ranking | 3 / 0.7486 | Eight notes led by note `#81`; memory `#6271` and primer `#2` filled the rest. |
| `conv-03` | Fusion ranking | 1 / 0.7242 | Ten notes, led by note `#677`, displaced the rank-1 gold chunk. |
| `conv-04` | Fusion ranking | 4 / 0.4931 | Ten notes, led by note `#1780`; P1 would rank the gold first. |
| `conv-06` | Per-lane ranking | 15 / 0.6287 | Gold was below the conversation top-10; message `@92933` and related design compartments won. |
| `conv-07` | Fusion ranking | 1 / 0.7130 | Nine notes led by `#1056`, plus memory `#8313`. |
| `conv-09` | Granularity/representation | >50 | Exact-title control also missed top 50; full winner note `#275`. The verified raw span mixes cutover, allowlist, and doctor work. |
| `conv-11` | Phrasing mismatch | 34 / 0.6311 | Rewording toward the corpus title moved the same gold to raw rank 2; ten notes led by `#1726`. |
| `conv-13` | Granularity/representation | >50 | A 117-row, 42.7k-character implementation span dilutes the compact “Pi command parity” topic; exact control also missed. |
| `conv-14` | Fusion ranking | 1 / 0.7568 | Nine notes led by `#1728`, plus primer `#2`. |
| `conv-16` | Fusion ranking | 3 / 0.6849 | Ten notes led by note `#985`. |

## Failure taxonomy

The taxonomy assigns one primary cause per full-search miss; categories can overlap in reality.

### Conversation failures only (10/20)

| Cause | Count | Share |
|---|---:|---:|
| Ranking/fusion loss | 7 | 70% |
| Phrasing mismatch | 1 | 10% |
| Granularity/representation loss | 2 | 20% |
| Coverage hole | 0 | 0% |
| Hard-filter exclusion | 0 | 0% |
| Genuine absence | 0 | 0% |

Six of the seven ranking failures had the gold raw chunk already at rank 1-4 and were lost only after broad fusion. The seventh was raw rank 15.

### All full-search failures (27/50)

| Primary cause | Count | Share | Examples |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Ranking/fusion loss | 15 | 55.6% | Six note-crowded conversation golds; six memory golds that were rank 1-3 in isolation; issue `#195`. |
| Searchable-field absence | 5 | 18.5% | Four full commit SHAs plus mixed SHA query; SHA is stored but unindexed/unmatched. |
| Granularity/representation loss | 3 | 11.1% | `conv-09`, `conv-13`, and `hard-06` (P1 rank 1 vs raw rank 30). |
| Phrasing/query mismatch | 2 | 7.4% | `conv-11`; long punctuated unresolved-session error rescued by extracted-keyterm FTS. |
| Hard-filter exclusion | 2 | 7.4% | Visible Alfonso memory `#15706`; live-tail message `@117830`. |
| Coverage hole | 0 | 0% | No selected gold lacked its current vector. |

“Searchable-field absence” is not physical row absence: the commit exists, but neither commit FTS nor its fallback searches SHA columns.

The live-tail control proves the boundary guard is non-vacuous. Query `raw messages compartment chunks` returned gold message `@117830` at unfiltered message-FTS rank 2, while the shipped cutoff at compartment end `116816` excluded it. This is correct behavior because the message remains visible in the live tail.

## Cheap-win probes

### 1. P1-summary vectors

The scratch probe embedded `title + "\n" + P1` for all 1,655 candidate compartments with the same provider and passage purpose.

| Representation | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Raw chunk | 12/20 | 16/20 | 16/20 |
| P1 summary | 12/20 | 15/20 | 15/20 |

P1 rescued **zero** raw-chunk misses at rank 10 and badly regressed `conv-01` (raw rank 3, P1 rank 129). It did help isolated mixed cases (`hard-06`: P1 rank 1 vs raw rank 30; `hard-04`: P1 rank 2 vs raw miss). Conclusion: do not replace raw chunks with P1 vectors. A narrowly auxiliary title/summary lane might help mixed or multi-topic failures, but it needs separate gating and more evidence.

### 2. Offline fusion reweighting

The probe re-sorted recorded production lane outputs; it did not change retrieval candidates.

| Conversation fusion | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 | Delta at 10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Shipped / offline reproduced baseline | 7/20 | 9/20 | 10/20 | — |
| +25% conversation-source weight | 7/20 | 11/20 | 15/20 | +25 pp |
| Class-aware: chunks/messages up, notes/memory down | 10/20 | 15/20 | 15/20 | +25 pp |
| Chunk-heavy class-aware | 11/20 | 15/20 | 16/20 | +30 pp |

The offline baseline reproduced shipped ranks exactly, validating the probe. The best weighting recovered the conversation lane's full recall@10 ceiling. It must not be global: fact/rule recall@10 fell from 3/10 to 0/10 under indiscriminate chunk-heavy weights.

### 3. Extracted-keyterm message FTS

The harness removes conversational stopwords, uses message-corpus document frequency to retain up to four discriminative terms, then either ANDs them or RRF-fuses production message-FTS calls.

| Message FTS form | R@1 | R@5 | R@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Original query | 1/20 | 5/20 | 5/20 |
| Extracted terms, AND | 4/20 | 7/20 | 7/20 |
| Extracted terms, per-term RRF | 4/20 | 7/20 | 8/20 |

This is a real but secondary win: +15 percentage points at rank 10 over message FTS, still half the chunk lane. It does not solve semantic zero-token paraphrases; only 1/6 such queries was rescued at rank 10.

## Ranked improvement directions

1. **Calibrate broad fusion for conversation intent; cap or demote note-only matches.**
   **Evidence:** full conversation R@10 50% vs isolated conversation 80%; notes occupy 58.5% of slots; chunk-heavy intent-aware reweighting restores 80%.
   **Work/value:** high value, low-to-medium implementation effort. Start with score-domain normalization and a per-source cap or minimum token-coverage threshold for notes, guarded by a conversation-intent classifier. Preserve note dominance for explicit note/follow-up queries.

2. **Fix semantic-only conversation score normalization before changing embeddings.**
   **Evidence:** six gold chunks at raw rank 1-4 vanish after fusion; their cosine-derived scores remain about 0.39-0.76 while notes are remapped to 1.0..0.7.
   **Work/value:** likely the smallest change that addresses the main complaint. Normalize every lane in rank domain or use RRF across lanes instead of comparing heterogeneous score meanings.

3. **Add cheap query-term extraction as a complementary message lane.**
   **Evidence:** message FTS R@10 improves from 25% to 40%, and R@1 from 5% to 20%.
   **Work/value:** low effort; useful for names and semi-lexical natural queries. It should complement, not replace, chunk vectors.

4. **Add exact SHA/short-SHA lookup to commit search.**
   **Evidence:** 0/4 exact-SHA controls; the commit row exists and is embedded, but SHA is `UNINDEXED` and LIKE searches message only. A query that adds descriptive words (`hard-10`) finds the commit at isolated rank 1.
   **Work/value:** tiny, deterministic win for overall `ctx_search`; not conversation-specific but too cheap and clear to ignore.

5. **Investigate targeted title/P1 augmentation only for multi-topic or raw-miss cases.**
   **Evidence:** broad P1 is worse (75% vs 80% R@10) and rescues no conversation miss, but helps two mixed cases.
   **Work/value:** uncertain. A second vector or late fallback is more defensible than replacing raw chunks. Require a larger benchmark before product work.

6. **Keep outage coverage observability and eager repair, but do not treat backfill as the primary recall fix.**
   **Evidence:** Synapse ledger was heavily partial during Aug 25-29, proving transient risk, yet current recent coverage is 100% and no study failure is a hole.
   **Work/value:** operational resilience rather than ranking quality. Snapshot hole counts before repair and expose age-bucket coverage in diagnostics.

7. **Do not pursue raw-message ANN or wholesale P1 replacement from this evidence.**
   **Evidence:** current chunk coverage is complete for the complaint corpus; chunk isolation already reaches 80% R@10; P1 does not improve it. The largest measured loss happens after retrieval, not before it.

## Limitations and next benchmark steps

- Golds are real and manually verified, but one user's machine and project vocabulary can overfit results. Extend the fixture rather than replacing rows.
- Conversation golds are all from the long Magic Context session; AFT and Alfonso are represented in fact/rule controls. Add 10-20 sibling conversation golds in the next run.
- P1 vectors were measured on one model and one `title + P1` representation. This rejects a blanket P1 replacement, not every possible summary representation.
- Ledger `partial` is an operational signal, not a typed cert-failure record. A future outage study should pair failure diagnostics with point-in-time coverage snapshots.
- Offline reweighting reuses the top 10 from each production lane. That is sufficient for top-10 recombination (a lane's rank 11 cannot enter the global top 10 ahead of its own first ten), but production validation still needs latency and regression tests.
- The benchmark was run while the live corpus continued to grow. All gold identities and boundaries were validated at run start; results record the exact generation timestamp in the ignored JSON snapshot.

## Full per-query result matrix

Ranks are 1-based; `—` means absent from that lane’s measured depth (top 10 except raw chunks at top 50 and P1 over the full candidate pool). `Conv.` is the shipped message source with chunk+message fusion. `Fusion*` is the best offline probe (`chunk-heavy`).
