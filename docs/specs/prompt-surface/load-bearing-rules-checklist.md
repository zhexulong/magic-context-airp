- **Source fragment:** `guidance-tool-history`
- **Scope:** primary sessions
- **Polarity:** prohibition
- **Operative condition:** Magic Context control markers appear in compressed or injected context.

### G-029 — Subagents receive only bounded reduction mechanics

- **Source fragment:** `guidance-subagent-reduce`
- **Scope:** subagent sessions
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** The session is a bounded single-task subagent with ctx_reduce.
- **Mechanism:** Compose the marker, tag range syntax, protected tail, silent reduction, no blanket drops, and real-tool requirement without primary partner, memory, note, or search curation.
- **Consequence:** A subagent gets the mechanics it can observe without primary-session obligations.
- **Source evidence:** `Minimal guidance for SUBAGENT sessions`
- **Fragment note:** The explicit dropped-sentinel imitation ban is emitted by SUBAGENT_REDUCE_INTRO only; BASE_INTRO has metadata non-reproduction language but does not emit this exact sentinel-pattern clause.

### G-030 — Subagent dropped-sentinel asymmetry

- **Source fragment:** `guidance-subagent-reduce`
- **Scope:** subagent sessions
- **Polarity:** prohibition
- **Operative condition:** Older tool calls appear as `[dropped §N§]` sentinels in a subagent context.
- **Mechanism:** Treat sentinels as normal context management, never as a pattern to copy; make a fresh real tool call and never fabricate or inline its output.
- **Consequence:** The dropped placeholder cannot be imitated as assistant content.
- **Source evidence:** `sentinels; that is normal context management, not a pattern to copy.`
- **Asymmetry:** This exact sentinel-imitation clause is present in SUBAGENT_REDUCE_INTRO and not in BASE_INTRO; the checklist intentionally keeps its primary rows not-present.
- **Fragment note:** The explicit dropped-sentinel imitation ban is emitted by SUBAGENT_REDUCE_INTRO only; BASE_INTRO has metadata non-reproduction language but does not emit this exact sentinel-pattern clause.

- **Mechanism:** Review each tag before selecting a drop range; never drop a large range blindly.
- **Consequence:** The bounded child does not discard mixed-value evidence by shortcut.
- **Source evidence:** `NEVER drop large ranges blindly`
- **Fragment note:** The explicit dropped-sentinel imitation ban is emitted by SUBAGENT_REDUCE_INTRO only; BASE_INTRO has metadata non-reproduction language but does not emit this exact sentinel-pattern clause.

- **Source fragment:** `guidance-reduce-closer`
- **Scope:** primary sessions with ctx_reduce
- **Polarity:** prohibition
- **Operative condition:** Context usage or a reduction prompt is visible.
- **Mechanism:** Treat reduction as routine maintenance and never reduce task scope or depth because context is large.
- **Consequence:** Cache maintenance cannot cause the agent to rush, defer, or omit work.
- **Source evidence:** `never let context size change *what* work you take on or *how thoroughly*`

### G-034 — No-reduce sessions are automatically managed

- **Source fragment:** `guidance-no-reduce-closer`

### T-009 — ctx_expand ordinal mode recovers one message

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-expand`
- **Scope:** ctx_expand tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** One exact message or dropped tool output is needed.
- **Mechanism:** Pass message=N to return all text parts and complete tool input/output for that ordinal.
- **Consequence:** A previously dropped output is recovered from storage rather than fabricated.
- **Source evidence:** `returns the FULL untruncated content of the message`

### T-010 — ctx_expand does not reread the live tail

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-expand`
- **Scope:** ctx_expand tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** A requested range is after the last compacted compartment.
- **Mechanism:** Treat that range as already visible live context and do not expand it.
- **Consequence:** The tool does not duplicate visible content and burn output tokens.
- **Source evidence:** `Ranges after the last compartment are your live tail`

### T-011 — ctx_note action contract

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-note`
- **Scope:** ctx_note tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** The agent has a future session concern.
- **Mechanism:** write saves, read lists, update changes, and dismiss retires notes; smart notes use surface_condition.
- **Consequence:** Each note action has an explicit lifecycle operation.
- **Source evidence:** `Actions:`

### T-012 — ctx_note smart conditions are external-only

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-note`
- **Scope:** ctx_note tool users
- **Polarity:** prohibition
- **Operative condition:** A smart note is requested.
- **Mechanism:** Use only externally verifiable signals from GitHub, disk, git history, or web pages; never a condition that depends on this conversation or an unobservable future action.
- **Consequence:** The background checker can evaluate the condition without conversation access.
- **Source evidence:** `using ONLY externally verifiable signals`

### T-013 — ctx_memory stores standalone durable facts

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-memory`
- **Scope:** ctx_memory tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** A fact must survive this session.
- **Mechanism:** Write one standalone fact that makes sense without session context, with a category and content.
- **Consequence:** Future sessions can use the memory without reconstructing this conversation.
- **Source evidence:** `one standalone fact, phrased to make sense without this session's context`

### T-014 — ctx_memory action and privilege boundary

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-memory`
- **Scope:** ctx_memory tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** A memory must be changed or fetched.
- **Mechanism:** Use write, update, archive, merge, or get; list remains dreamer-only.
- **Consequence:** Primary agents cannot assume the dreamer-only list action is available.
- **Source evidence:** `remains dreamer-only`

### T-015 — ctx_search returns only hidden history

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-search`
- **Scope:** ctx_search tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** The agent needs project recall.
- **Mechanism:** Search memories, compacted messages, git commits, and notes while filtering memories already rendered in project-memory and the live conversation tail.
- **Consequence:** Search fills missing context rather than duplicating visible context.
- **Source evidence:** `Results only contain things you CANNOT currently see`

### T-016 — ctx_memory retrieval and source privilege

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-memory`
- **Scope:** ctx_memory tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** A known memory ID must be retrieved or a list operation is considered.
- **Mechanism:** Use get with numeric IDs; fetched memories are readable in every status, while list remains dreamer-only.
- **Consequence:** Primary agents use the supported retrieval path and do not assume dreamer browsing privileges.
- **Source evidence:** `readable in every status`

### T-017 — ctx_search source routing and ID lookup

- **Source fragment:** `tool-ctx-search`
- **Scope:** ctx_search tool users
- **Polarity:** contract
- **Operative condition:** A recall query needs a source boundary or direct memory lookup.
- **Mechanism:** Omit sources for broad search, select memory/message/git_commit/note sources for targeted retrieval, or pass memory IDs to bypass text search; message hits continue through ctx_expand.
- **Consequence:** Search scope and exact-memory lookup are explicit rather than guessed.
- **Source evidence:** `Sources (omit for a broad search across all):`

## Review notes

- The `[dropped §N§]` imitation prohibition is deliberately listed as `G-030` with `compressed` only for `subagent-reduce`; primary variants are `not-present` for this exact SUBAGENT_REDUCE_INTRO clause.
- Tool descriptions are included as load-bearing contract/mechanism rules, with active and memory-disabled tool compositions represented separately.
- No light prose is authored by this artifact. S3 must replace pending compressed targets with exact light lines after ratification.
