# Changelog

Magic Context ships three npm packages from this repo (`@cortexkit/magic-context`, `@cortexkit/opencode-magic-context`, `@cortexkit/pi-magic-context`) and a Tauri dashboard. All three plugin packages share a single version line and ship together. The dashboard tracks its own `dashboard-vX.Y.Z` tag line.

## Source of truth

Full per-release notes live in GitHub Releases — that's the canonical, user-facing changelog:

- **Plugin/CLI releases:** https://github.com/cortexkit/magic-context/releases (filtered to `v0.*` tags)
- **Dashboard releases:** same page, filtered to `dashboard-v0.*` tags

This file exists as a quick navigation map. Working drafts that became those release notes are kept under `.alfonso/release-notes/` for reference.

## Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While the public surface is pre-1.0:

- `MINOR` bumps (`0.21.0` → `0.22.0`) carry user-visible feature additions or breaking config migrations.
- `PATCH` bumps (`0.21.6` → `0.21.7`) carry bug fixes and small enhancements that don't change config shape or break existing setups.
- Migrations that change config shape always ship with an in-memory shim so existing configs keep working until you run `doctor` to rewrite them on disk.

## Unreleased

The prompt surface is now split cleanly between desk-oriented system guidance and tool/parameter contracts: agents get a shorter orientation with explicit filing, search, pinboard, tray, and stamping triggers, while each tool owns its operational details. Dreamer bulk memory enumeration moved from `ctx_memory(action="list")` to the dreamer-only `ctx_memory_list` tool, which never appears in a primary provider tool list. Because the system prompt and tool schemas change, every existing session pays one prompt-cache rewrite on its first turn after upgrading.
