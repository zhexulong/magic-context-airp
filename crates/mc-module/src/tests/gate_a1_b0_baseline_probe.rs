//! Probes that are deliberately written against the pre-A1 API surface so the
//! SAME file compiles and runs on the base commit `991046ca` as well as here.
//!
//! The acceptance bar for the host-runner slice is "with the default runner,
//! nothing changed". That is a claim about two different byte streams, and a
//! test that only runs on the new tree cannot check either of them: it would
//! assert that today's bytes equal today's bytes. So these probes reduce each
//! stream to one digest, and the gate runs the identical file on both trees and
//! compares the digests.
//!
//! - The historian request digest covers exactly what leaves the module for the
//!   completion provider: the system prompt, the user prompt, and the model.
//! - The served digest covers what the harness receives back from a fold pass.
//! - The meta digest covers the durable session blob, which is the one stream
//!   the slice DOES change (it gains an attempt field) and therefore has to be
//!   measured rather than assumed.
//!
//! Only the first two are asserted against pinned values. The meta digest is
//! reported, because its whole point is that it differs between the two trees.
