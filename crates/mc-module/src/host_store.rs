//! Single-store writer: the module writing the host's `context.db` domain tables.
//!
//! Today the module owns `store.db` and a changefeed mirror copies domain rows into
//! `context.db`, which every interactive seat reads. This module is the first half of
//! removing that seam: it writes the domain tables directly, under the same discipline
//! the TypeScript host writes them under.
//!
//! Three rules shape everything here.
//!
//! 1. **`context.db` is a versioned external schema.** The module opens it, never
//!    migrates it, and refuses to write when the schema it finds is not the schema it
//!    was built against. "Not the schema" is decided per table: each table the module
//!    writes has its full `sqlite_master` surface — its columns, its CHECK/UNIQUE
//!    constraints, its indexes, and its triggers — hashed and compared with the value
//!    baked in below. A host migration that leaves a table's surface alone leaves that
//!    table writable, whatever the migration lane now says; one that changes it fails
//!    that table closed with a typed refusal. The check is repeated inside every write
//!    transaction, because a migration can land between opening the file and writing
//!    to it.
//!
//! 2. **The authority guards stay armed.** `context.db` carries triggers that abort a
//!    memory or note write for a managed project unless `context_privilege_state.enabled`
//!    is 1. Those triggers are the fail-closed net against a confused writer, so the
//!    module does not remove them: it flips the row to 1 inside its own
//!    `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction and back to 0 before committing, exactly as the host
//!    does. A second connection never observes the flip, because it never observes an
//!    uncommitted transaction.
//!
//! 3. **A fold publish is split into bounded chunks.** One fold is the largest write in
//!    the system, and it lands in the file every interactive seat depends on behind a
//!    five-second busy timeout. Each chunk is its own transaction with its own flip, and
//!    the chunks are ordered so that the rows a reader composes session history from —
//!    the compartments, their facts, their events — all land in the final chunk. A reader
//!    between chunks sees the session exactly as it was before the fold started.
//!
//! In this slice the writers are shadow/verify only. `single_store: "on"` is refused by
//! name; `"shadow"` writes to a scratch copy of the file and reports how the rows it
//! produced differ from the rows already in `context.db`.
