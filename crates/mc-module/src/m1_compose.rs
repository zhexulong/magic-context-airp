//! The store → m1 delta producer for bust arms, in TWO tiers (the
//! compose-on-opportunity discipline):
//!
//!  - [`m1_revision_signal`] is the CHEAP per-pass read: split in-session and external
//!    fingerprints run EVERY pass to tell the classifier whether work is pending and whether
//!    a render-config HARD is due, WITHOUT composing the body. In-session changes are allowed
//!    to remain pending so ordinary turns replay frozen bytes; external workspace changes stay
//!    eager-HARD.
//!  - [`compose_m1_from_store`] is the EXPENSIVE bust-only read: it composes the actual m1
//!    delta body (memory-updates + new-compartments + new-memories) from the store and
//!    reports whether a newly-published compartment EXTENDS coverage (so the bust must
//!    advance the boundary anchor). Runs ONLY on a bust opportunity — never on a defer (a
//!    defer replays the frozen m1 verbatim; re-composing from the now-possibly-mutated store
//!    on a defer would change bytes on a defer, violating the deferred-work invariant).
