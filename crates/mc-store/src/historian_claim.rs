//! The claim lane: historian runs whose model call is made by a host process
//! rather than by this module.
//!
//! A run enters the lane when the module has assembled a chunk and built the
//! prompt but has no producer of its own to send it to. The run is queued, a
//! claimant (the host serving that session) takes it under a lease, and the
//! module accepts exactly one terminal report per claim. Chunking, validation,
//! the publish CAS and the failure taxonomy all stay module-side and are
//! identical whichever side made the call.
//!
//! Two rules make this safe without trusting the claimant:
//!
//! 1. The module mints the attempt number and the token. A claimant never
//!    chooses either, so it cannot forge a newer claim than the one it holds.
//! 2. What a report presents is the token, not an identity. A claimant that
//!    stalled and was replaced still holds a real token, but not the CURRENT
//!    one, so its late report is refused before its output is parsed. Refusing
//!    on identity instead would let a restarted claimant with the same install
//!    identity publish over its own replacement.
